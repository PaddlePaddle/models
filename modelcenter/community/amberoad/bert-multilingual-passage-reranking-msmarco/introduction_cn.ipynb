    "# Passage Reranking Multilingual BERT üîÉ üåç\n",

    "\n",
    "## Model description\n",
    "**Input:** Supports over 100 Languages. See [List of supported languages](https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/multilingual.md#list-of-languages) for all available.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** This module takes a search query [1] and a passage [2] and calculates if the passage matches the query.\n",
    "It can be used as an improvement for Elasticsearch Results and boosts the relevancy by up to 100%.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture:** On top of BERT there is a Densly Connected NN which takes the 768 Dimensional [CLS] Token as input and provides the output ([Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04085)).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:** Just a single value between between -10 and 10. Better matching query,passage pairs tend to have a higher a score.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intended uses & limitations\n",
    "Both query[1] and passage[2] have to fit in 512 Tokens.\n",
    "As you normally want to rerank the first dozens of search results keep in mind the inference time of approximately 300 ms/query.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to use\n"

    "## Training data\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is trained using the [**Microsoft MS Marco Dataset**](https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/ \"Microsoft MS Marco\"). This training dataset contains approximately 400M tuples of a query, relevant and non-relevant passages. All datasets used for training and evaluating are listed in this [table](https://github.com/microsoft/MSMARCO-Passage-Ranking#data-information-and-formating). The used dataset for training is called *Train Triples Large*, while the evaluation was made on *Top 1000 Dev*. There are 6,900 queries in total in the development dataset, where each query is mapped to top 1,000 passage retrieved using BM25 from MS MARCO corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "The training is performed the same way as stated in this [README](https://github.com/nyu-dl/dl4marco-bert \"NYU Github\"). See their excellent Paper on [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04085).\n",
    "\n",
    "We changed the BERT Model from an English only to the default BERT Multilingual uncased Model from [Google](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-multilingual-uncased).\n",
    "\n",
    "Training was done 400 000 Steps. This equaled 12 hours an a TPU V3-8.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Eval results\n",
    "\n",
    "We see nearly similar performance than the English only Model in the English [Bing Queries Dataset](http://www.msmarco.org/). Although the training data is English only internal Tests on private data showed a far higher accurancy in German than all other available models.\n",
