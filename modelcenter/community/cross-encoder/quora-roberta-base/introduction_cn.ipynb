    "## Training Data\n",
    "This model was trained on the [Quora Duplicate Questions](https://www.quora.com/q/quoradata/First-Quora-Dataset-Release-Question-Pairs) dataset. The model will predict a score between 0 and 1 how likely the two given questions are duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The model is not suitable to estimate the similarity of questions, e.g. the two questions \"How to learn Java\" and \"How to learn Python\" will result in a rahter low score, as these are not duplicates.\n",
