    "# XtremeDistilTransformers for Distilling Massive Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "XtremeDistilTransformers is a distilled task-agnostic transformer model that leverages task transfer for learning a small universal model that can be applied to arbitrary tasks and languages as outlined in the paper [XtremeDistilTransformers: Task Transfer for Task-agnostic Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04563).\n",
    "\n",
    "We leverage task transfer combined with multi-task distillation techniques from the papers [XtremeDistil: Multi-stage Distillation for Massive Multilingual Models](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.202.pdf) and [MiniLM: Deep Self-Attention Distillation for Task-Agnostic Compression of Pre-Trained Transformers](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf) with the following [Github code](https://github.com/microsoft/xtreme-distil-transformers).\n",
