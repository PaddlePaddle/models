However, most pretraining efforts focus on general domain corpora, such as newswire and Web. A prevailing assumption is that even domain-specific pretraining can benefit by starting from general-domain language models. [Recent work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15779) shows that for domains with abundant unlabeled text, such as biomedicine, pretraining language models from scratch results in substantial gains over continual pretraining of general-domain language models.\n", "\n", "This PubMedBERT is pretrained from scratch using _abstracts_ from [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).
