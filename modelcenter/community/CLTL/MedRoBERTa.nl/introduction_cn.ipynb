The model is not fine-tuned.

Since it is a domain-specific model trained on medical data, it is meant to be used on medical NLP tasks for Dutch.\n", "\n", "## Data\n", "The model was trained on nearly 10 million hospital notes from the Amsterdam University Medical Centres. The training data was anonymized before starting the pre-training procedure.\n", "\n", "## Privacy\n", "By anonymizing the training data we made sure the model did not learn any representative associations linked to names. Apart from the training data, the model's vocabulary was also anonymized. This ensures that the model can not predict any names in the generative fill-mask task.\n", "\n", "## Authors\n", "Stella Verkijk, Piek Vossen\n", "\n", "## Reference\n", "Paper: Verkijk, S. & Vossen, P.
