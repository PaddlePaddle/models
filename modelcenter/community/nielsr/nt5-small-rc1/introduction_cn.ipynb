    "# NT5, a T5 model trained to perform numerical reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "T5-small model pre-trained on 3 million (partly synthetic) texts and fine-tuned on [DROP](https://allennlp.org/drop.html). It was introduced in the paper [NT5?! Training T5 to Perform Numerical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07307) by Yang et al. and first released in [this repository](https://github.com/lesterpjy/numeric-t5). As the original implementation was in Tensorflow 2, I've converted the weigths to PyTorch. This model corresponds to RC Experiment 1 (see the paper), their best performing model.\n",

    "Disclaimer: The team releasing NT5 did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by me.\n",

    "## Model description\n",
    "\n",
    "The NT5 model is a T5 model, in other words, an encoder-decoder Transformer. In order to encourage numerical reasoning, the model was further pre-trained on three datasets designed to strengthen skills necessary for numerical reasoning over text (NRoT) and general reading comprehension before being fine-tuned on the Discrete Reasoning over Text (DROP) dataset.\n",

    "## Intended uses & limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the model for numerical reasoning over text.\n",
