    "\n",
    "**bert-large-NER** is a fine-tuned BERT model that is ready to use for **Named Entity Recognition** and achieves **state-of-the-art performance** for the NER task. It has been trained to recognize four types of entities: location (LOC), organizations (ORG), person (PER) and Miscellaneous (MISC).\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, this model is a *bert-large-cased* model that was fine-tuned on the English version of the standard [CoNLL-2003 Named Entity Recognition](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W03-0419.pdf) dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you'd like to use a smaller BERT model fine-tuned on the same dataset, a [**bert-base-NER**](https://huggingface.co/dslim/bert-base-NER/) version is also available.\n",

    "#### How to use\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use this model with Transformers *pipeline* for NER.\n"
