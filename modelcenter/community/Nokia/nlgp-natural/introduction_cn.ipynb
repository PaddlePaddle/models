    "The NLGP natural model was introduced in the paper [Natural Language-Guided Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05198).  The model was trained on a collection of Jupyter notebooks and can be used to synthesize Python code that addresses a natural language **intent** in a certain code **context** (see the example below). This work was carried out by a research team in Nokia Bell Labs.\n",
