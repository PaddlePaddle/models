    "## Introduction\n",
    "**MacBERT** is an improved BERT with novel **M**LM **a**s **c**orrection pre-training task, which mitigates the discrepancy of pre-training and fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of masking with [MASK] token, which never appears in the ﬁne-tuning stage, **we propose to use similar words for the masking purpose**. A similar word is obtained by using [Synonyms toolkit (Wang and Hu, 2017)](https://github.com/chatopera/Synonyms), which is based on word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) similarity calculations. If an N-gram is selected to mask, we will ﬁnd similar words individually. In rare cases, when there is no similar word, we will degrade to use random word replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of our pre-training task.\n",
    "|  | Example       |\n",
    "| -------------- | ----------------- |\n",
    "| **Original Sentence**  | we use a language model to predict the probability of the next word. |\n",
    "|  **MLM** | we use a language [M] to [M] ##di ##ct the pro [M] ##bility of the next word . |\n",
    "| **Whole word masking**   | we use a language [M] to [M] [M] [M] the [M] [M] [M] of the next word . |\n",
    "| **N-gram masking** | we use a [M] [M] to [M] [M] [M] the [M] [M] [M] [M] [M] next word . |\n",
    "| **MLM as correction** | we use a text system to ca ##lc ##ulate the po ##si ##bility of the next word . |\n",
    "\n",
    "Except for the new pre-training task, we also incorporate the following techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Whole Word Masking (WWM)\n",
    "- N-gram masking\n",
    "- Sentence-Order Prediction (SOP)\n",

    "**Note that our MacBERT can be directly replaced with the original BERT as there is no differences in the main neural architecture.**\n",
