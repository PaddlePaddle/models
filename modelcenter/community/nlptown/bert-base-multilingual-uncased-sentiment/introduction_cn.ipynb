    "\n",
    "This a bert-base-multilingual-uncased model finetuned for sentiment analysis on product reviews in six languages: English, Dutch, German, French, Spanish and Italian. It predicts the sentiment of the review as a number of stars (between 1 and 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is intended for direct use as a sentiment analysis model for product reviews in any of the six languages above, or for further finetuning on related sentiment analysis tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training data\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the number of product reviews we used for finetuning the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Language | Number of reviews |\n",
    "| -------- | ----------------- |\n",
    "| English  | 150k           |\n",

    "| French   | 140k           |\n",

    "| Spanish  | 50k            |\n",

    "## Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "The finetuned model obtained the following accuracy on 5,000 held-out product reviews in each of the languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accuracy (exact) is the exact match on the number of stars.\n",
    "- Accuracy (off-by-1) is the percentage of reviews where the number of stars the model predicts differs by a maximum of 1 from the number given by the human reviewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Language | Accuracy (exact) | Accuracy (off-by-1) |\n",
    "| -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |\n",

    "| German   | 61%                 | 94%\n",
    "| French   | 59%                 | 94%\n",
