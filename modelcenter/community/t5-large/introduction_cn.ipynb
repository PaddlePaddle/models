    "The developers of the Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) [write](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/02/exploring-transfer-learning-with-t5.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "> With T5, we propose reframing all NLP tasks into a unified text-to-text-format where the input and output are always text strings, in contrast to BERT-style models that can only output either a class label or a span of the input. Our text-to-text framework allows us to use the same model, loss function, and hyperparameters on any NLP task.\n",
