    "# GPorTuguese-2: a Language Model for Portuguese text generation (and more NLP tasks...)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "GPorTuguese-2 (Portuguese GPT-2 small) is a state-of-the-art language model for Portuguese based on the GPT-2 small model.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was trained on Portuguese Wikipedia using **Transfer Learning and Fine-tuning techniques** in just over a day, on one GPU NVIDIA V100 32GB and with a little more than 1GB of training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a proof-of-concept that it is possible to get a state-of-the-art language model in any language with low ressources.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was fine-tuned from the [English pre-trained GPT-2 small](https://huggingface.co/gpt2) using the Hugging Face libraries (Transformers and Tokenizers) wrapped into the [fastai v2](https://dev.fast.ai/) Deep Learning framework. All the fine-tuning fastai v2 techniques were used.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is now available on Hugging Face.

    "GPT-2 is a transformers model pretrained on a very large corpus of English data in a self-supervised fashion. This means it was pretrained on the raw texts only, with no humans labelling them in any way (which is why it can use lots of publicly available data) with an automatic process to generate inputs and labels from those texts. More precisely, it was trained to guess the next word in sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, inputs are sequences of continuous text of a certain length and the targets are the same sequence, shifted one token (word or piece of word) to the right. The model uses internally a mask-mechanism to make sure the predictions for the token `i` only uses the inputs from `1` to `i` but not the future tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, the model learns an inner representation of the English language that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks. The model is best at what it was pretrained for however, which is generating texts from a prompt.\n",
