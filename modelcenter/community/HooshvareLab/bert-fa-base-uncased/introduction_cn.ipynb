    "\n",
    "ParsBERT is a monolingual language model based on Google’s BERT architecture. This model is pre-trained on large Persian corpora with various writing styles from numerous subjects (e.g., scientific, novels, news) with more than `3.9M` documents, `73M` sentences, and `1.3B` words.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Intended uses & limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the raw model for either masked language modeling or next sentence prediction, but it's mostly intended to\n",
    "be fine-tuned on a downstream task. See the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?search=bert-fa) to look for\n",
