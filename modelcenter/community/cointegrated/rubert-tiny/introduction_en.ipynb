    "This is a very small distilled version of the [bert-base-multilingual-cased](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-multilingual-cased) model for Russian and English (45 MB, 12M parameters). There is also an **updated version of this model**, [rubert-tiny2](https://huggingface.co/cointegrated/rubert-tiny2), with a larger vocabulary and better quality on practically all Russian NLU tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is useful if you want to fine-tune it for a relatively simple Russian task (e.g. NER or sentiment classification), and you care more about speed and size than about accuracy. It is approximately x10 smaller and faster than a base-sized BERT. Its `[CLS]` embeddings can be used as a sentence representation aligned between Russian and English.\n",
