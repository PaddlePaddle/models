    "**How do I pronounce the name of the model?** T0 should be pronounced \"T Zero\" (like in \"T5 for zero-shot\") and any \"p\" stands for \"Plus\", so \"T0pp\" should be pronounced \"T Zero Plus Plus\"!\n",

    "# Model Description\n",
    "\n",
    "T0* shows zero-shot task generalization on English natural language prompts, outperforming GPT-3 on many tasks, while being 16x smaller. It is a series of encoder-decoder models trained on a large set of different tasks specified in natural language prompts. We convert numerous English supervised datasets into prompts, each with multiple templates using varying formulations. These prompted datasets allow for benchmarking the ability of a model to perform completely unseen tasks specified in natural language. To obtain T0*, we fine-tune a pretrained language model on this multitask mixture covering many different NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Intended uses\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the models to perform inference on tasks by specifying your query in natural language, and the models will generate a prediction. For instance, you can ask *\"Is this review positive or negative? Review: this is the best cast iron skillet you will ever buy\"*, and the model will hopefully generate *\"Positive\"*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few other examples that you can try:\n",
    "- *A is the son's of B's uncle. What is the family relationship between A and B?*\n",
    "- *Question A: How is air traffic controlled?<br>\n",
    "Question B: How do you become an air traffic controller?<br>\n",
    "Pick one: these questions are duplicates or not duplicates.*\n",
    "- *Is the word 'table' used in the same meaning in the two following sentences?<br><br>\n",
    "Sentence A: you can leave the books on the table over there.<br>\n",
    "Sentence B: the tables in this book are very hard to read.*\n",
    "- *Max: Know any good websites to buy clothes from?<br>\n",
    "Payton: Sure :) LINK 1, LINK 2, LINK 3<br>\n",
    "Max: That's a lot of them!<br>\n",
    "Payton: Yeah, but they have different things so I usually buy things from 2 or 3 of them.<br>\n",
    "Max: I'll check them out. Thanks.<br><br>\n",
    "Who or what are Payton and Max referring to when they say 'them'?*\n",
    "- *On a shelf, there are five books: a gray book, a red book, a purple book, a blue book, and a black book.<br>\n",
    "The red book is to the right of the gray book. The black book is to the left of the blue book. The blue book is to the left of the gray book. The purple book is the second from the right.<br><br>\n",
    "Which book is the leftmost book?*\n",
    "- *Reorder the words in this sentence: justin and name bieber years is my am I 27 old.*\n",
