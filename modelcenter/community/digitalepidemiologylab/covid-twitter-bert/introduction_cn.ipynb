    "This model was trained on 160M tweets collected between January 12 and April 16, 2020 containing at least one of the keywords \"wuhan\", \"ncov\", \"coronavirus\", \"covid\", or \"sars-cov-2\". These tweets were filtered and preprocessed to reach a final sample of 22.5M tweets (containing 40.7M sentences and 633M tokens) which were used for training.\n"
