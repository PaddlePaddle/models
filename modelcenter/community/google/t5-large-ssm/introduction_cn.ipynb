In this short paper, we measure the practical utility of this approach by fine-tuning pre-trained models to answer questions without access to any external context or knowledge. We show that this approach scales with model size and performs competitively with open-domain systems that explicitly retrieve answers from an external knowledge source when answering questions. To facilitate reproducibility and future work, we release our code and trained models at https://goo.gle/t5-cbqa.\n", "\n", "![model image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrickvonplaten/scientific_images/master/how_much_know_ledge_image.png)\n", "> 此模型来源于：[https://huggingface.co/google/t5-large-ssm](https://huggingface.co/https://huggingface.co/google/t5-large-ssm)"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "> 此模型来源于：[google/t5-large-ssm](https://huggingface.co/google/t5-large-ssm)"}], "metadata": {"language_info": {"name": "python"}, "orig_nbformat": 4}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 2}
