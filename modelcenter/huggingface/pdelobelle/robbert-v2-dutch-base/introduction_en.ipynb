of the number of GPUs available, in order to maximally utilize the cluster.\n", "Using the [Fairseq library](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/examples/roberta), the model trained for two epochs, which equals over 16k batches in total, which took about three days on the computing cluster.\n", "In between training jobs on the computing cluster, 2 Nvidia 1080 Ti's also covered some
