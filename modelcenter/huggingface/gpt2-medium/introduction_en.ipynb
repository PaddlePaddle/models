Results on language modeling datasets are commonly reported in a quantity which is a scaled or ex- ponentiated version of the average negative log probability per canonical prediction unit - usually a character, a byte, or a word. We evaluate the same quantity by computing the log-probability of a dataset according to a WebText LM and dividing by the number of canonical units. For many of these datasets, WebText LMs would be tested significantly out- of-distribution, having to predict aggressively standardized text, tokenization artifacts such as disconnected punctuation and contractions, shuffled sentences, and even the string <UNK> which is extremely rare in WebText - occurring only 26 times in 40 billion bytes. We report our main results...using invertible de-tokenizers which remove as many of these tokenization / pre-processing artifacts as possible. Since these de-tokenizers are invertible, we can still calculate the log probability of a dataset and they can be thought of as a simple form of domain adaptation.\n", "\n", "#### Results\n", "\n", "The model achieves the following results without any fine-tuning (zero-shot):\n", "\n", "| Dataset  | LAMBADA | LAMBADA | CBT-CN | CBT-NE | WikiText2 | PTB    | enwiki8 | text8  | WikiText103 | 1BW   |\n", "|:--------:|:-------:|:-------:|:------:|:------:|:---------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|:-----------:|:-----:|\n", "| (metric) | (PPL)   | (ACC)   | (ACC)  | (ACC)  | (PPL)     | (PPL)  | (BPB)   | (BPC)  | (PPL)       | (PPL) |\n", "|          | 15.60   | 55.48   | 92.35  | 87.1   | 22.76     | 47.33  | 1.01    | 1.06   | 26.37       | 55.72 |\n", "\n", "## Environmental Impact\n", "\n", "Carbon emissions can be estimated using the [Machine Learning Impact calculator](https://mlco2.github.io/impact#compute) presented in [Lacoste et al.
