We train the model on a very large and heterogeneous French corpus.

Besides, many tasks may be formatted such that the output is directly generated in natural language. Such configuration may be used for tasks such as automatic summary or question answering. We do hope our model might be used for both academic and industrial applications.\n", "\n", "#### How to use\n", "\n", "The model might be used through the astonishing 🤗 `Transformers` librairie. We use the work from [Shoeybi et al., (2019)](#shoeybi-2019) and calibrate our model such that during pre-training or fine-tuning, the model can fit on a single NVIDIA V100 32GB GPU.\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "metadata": {}, "source": ["from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel\n", "\n", "# Load pretrained model and tokenizer\n", "model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(\"asi/gpt-fr-cased-base\")\n", "tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(\"asi/gpt-fr-cased-base\")\n", "\n", "# Generate a sample of text\n", "model.eval()\n", "input_sentence = \"Longtemps je me suis couché de bonne heure.\"\n", "input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_sentence, return_tensors='pt')\n", "\n", "beam_outputs = model.generate(\n", "input_ids,\n", "max_length=100,\n", "do_sample=True,\n", "top_k=50,\n", "top_p=0.95,\n", "num_return_sequences=1\n", ")\n", "\n", "print(\"Output:\\n\" + 100 * '-')\n", "print(tokenizer.decode(beam_outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))\n"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["#### Limitations and bias\n", "\n", "Large language models tend to replicate the biases found in pre-training datasets, such as gender discrimination or offensive content generation.\n", "\n", "To limit exposition to too much explicit material, we carefully choose the sources beforehand. This process — detailed in our paper — aims to limit offensive content generation from the model without performing manual and arbitrary filtering.\n", "\n", "However, some societal biases, contained in the data, might be reflected by the model. For example on gender equality, we generated the following sentence sequence \"Ma femme/Mon mari vient d'obtenir un nouveau poste en tant \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\". We used top-k random sampling strategy with k=50 and stopped at the first punctuation element.\n", "The positions generated for the wife is '_que professeur de français._' while the position for the husband is '_que chef de projet._'. We do appreciate your feedback to better qualitatively and quantitatively assess such effects.\n", "\n", "## Training data\n", "\n", "We created a dedicated corpus to train our generative model. Indeed the model uses a fixed-length context size of 1,024 and require long documents to be trained.

We perform the training within a total of 140 hours of computation on Tesla V-100 hardware (TDP of 300W). The training was distributed on 4 compute nodes of 8 GPUs. We used data parallelization in order to divide each micro-batch on the computing units. We estimated the total emissions at 580.61 kgCO2eq, using the [Machine Learning Impact calculator](https://mlco2.github.io/impact#compute) presented in [Lacoste et al., (2019)](lacoste-2019).\n", "\n", "## Eval results\n", "\n", "We packaged **GPT-fr** with a dedicated language model evaluation benchmark for French.\n", "In line with the [WikiText](https://blog.einstein.ai/the-wikitext-long-term-dependency-language-modeling-dataset/) benchmark in English, we collected over 70 million tokens from the set of verified [good](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikip%C3%A9dia:Articles_de_qualit%C3%A9) and [featured](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikip%C3%A9dia:Bons_articles) articles on Wikipedia.
