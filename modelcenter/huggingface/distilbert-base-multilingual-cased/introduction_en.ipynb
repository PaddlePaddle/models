See the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?filter=bert) to look for fine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.\n", "\n", "Note that this model is primarily aimed at being fine-tuned on tasks that use the whole sentence (potentially masked) to make decisions, such as sequence classification, token classification or question answering. For tasks such as text generation you should look at model like GPT2.\n", "\n", "## Out of Scope Use\n", "\n", "The model should not be used to intentionally create hostile or alienating environments for people. The model was not trained to be factual or true representations of people or events, and therefore using the models to generate such content is out-of-scope for the abilities of this model.\n", "\n", "# Bias, Risks, and Limitations\n", "\n", "Significant research has explored bias and fairness issues with language models (see, e.g., [Sheng et al.
