The performance of the dialogue system has been improved recently by the method utilizing dialogue-related knowledge; however, non-English dialogue systems suffer from reproducing the performance of English dialogue systems because securing knowledge in the same language with the dialogue system is relatively difficult. Through experiments with a Korean dialogue system, this paper proves that the performance of a non-English dialogue system can be improved by utilizing English knowledge, highlighting the system uses cross-lingual knowledge. For the experiments, we 1) constructed a Korean version of the Wizard of Wikipedia dataset, 2) built Korean-English T5 (KE-T5), a language model pre-trained with Korean and English corpus, and 3) developed a knowledge-grounded Korean dialogue model based on KE-T5. We observed the performance improvement in the open-domain Korean dialogue model even only English knowledge was given. The experimental results showed that the knowledge inherent in cross-lingual language models can be helpful for generating responses in open dialogue systems.\",\n", "}\n"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["> 此模型来源于：[https://huggingface.co/KETI-AIR/ke-t5-base](https://huggingface.co/https://huggingface.co/KETI-AIR/ke-t5-base)"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "> 此模型来源于：[KETI-AIR/ke-t5-base](https://huggingface.co/KETI-AIR/ke-t5-base)"}], "metadata": {"language_info": {"name": "python"}, "orig_nbformat": 4}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 2}
