    "## 1. ERNIE-M Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "ERNIE-M, proposed by Baidu, is a new training method that encourages the model to align the representation of multiple languages with monolingual corpora, to overcome the constraint that the parallel corpus size places on the model performance. The insight is to integrate back-translation into the pre-training process by generating pseudo-parallel sentence pairs on a monolingual corpus to enable the learning of semantic alignments between different languages, thereby enhancing the semantic modeling of cross-lingual models. Experimental results show that ERNIE-M outperforms existing cross-lingual models and delivers new state-of-the-art results in various cross-lingual downstream tasks.\n",

    "This project is a PaddlePaddle dynamic graph implementation of ERNIE-M, including model training, model validation, etc."
