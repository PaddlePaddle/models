    "We developed a series of lightweight models, named PP-PicoDet. Because of the excellent performance, our models are very suitable for deployment on mobile or CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PP-PicoDet model has the following characteristics:\n",
    "- üåü Higher mAP: the **first** object detectors that surpass mAP(0.5:0.95) **30+** within 1M parameters when the input size is 416.\n",
    "- üöÄ Faster latency: 150FPS on mobile ARM CPU.\n",
    "- üòä Deploy friendly: support PaddleLite/MNN/NCNN/OpenVINO and provide C++/Python/Android implementation.\n",
    "- üòç Advanced algorithm: use the most advanced algorithms and offer innovation, such as ESNet, CSP-PAN, SimOTA with VFL, etc.\n",
