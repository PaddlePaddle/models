    "# 1. UIE Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[UIE(Universal Information Extraction)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.12277.pdf)：Yaojie Lu et al. proposed the universal information extraction unified framework UIE in ACL-2022. The framework achieves the unified modeling of entity extraction, relationship extraction, event extraction, sentiment analysis and other tasks, and makes different tasks have good migration and generalization capabilities. In order to facilitate the use of UIE's powerful capabilities, PaddleNLP released the first Chinese general information extraction model, UIE, based on the ERNIE 3.0 knowledge enhancement pretrained model. The model supports key information extraction without limitation of the industry field and extraction domain, achieving excellent few-shot finetune ability to adapt to specific extraction domain.\n",

Users can use natural language to customize the extraction target, and can uniformly extract the corresponding information in the input text without training。 **Realize out-of-the-box use and meet various information extraction requirements**."
