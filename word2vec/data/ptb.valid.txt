 yesterday 's selling began after a japanese news agency reported that japanese banks which balked at the first bid were ready to reject a revised version at around $ N a share or $ N billion 
 several reports as the day <unk> gave vague or <unk> indications about whether banks would sign up 
 citicorp for example said only that it had <unk> of interest of a transaction from both the borrowers and the banks but did n't have an agreement

 right away you notice the following things about a philip glass concert 
 it attracts people with funny hair or with no hair in front of me a girl with <unk> <unk> sat <unk> a boy who had <unk> his 
 whoever constitute the local left bank come out in force dressed in black along with a <unk> of <unk> who want to be on the cutting edge 
 people in glass houses tend to look <unk> 
 and if still <unk> at the evening 's end you notice something else the audience at first <unk> and <unk> by the music releases its <unk> feelings in collective <unk> 
 currently in the middle of a <unk> <unk> tour as a solo <unk> mr. glass has left behind his <unk> equipment and <unk> in favor of going it alone 
 he sits down at the piano and plays 
 and plays 
 either one likes it or one does n't 
 the typical glass audience which is more likely to be composed of music students than their teachers certainly does 
 the work though sounds like <unk> for <unk> 
 philip glass is the <unk> and his music the new clothes of the <unk> 
 his success is easy to understand 
 <unk> introducing and explaining his pieces mr. glass looks and sounds more like a <unk> <unk> describing his work than a classical <unk> playing a recital 
 the piano <unk> which have been labeled <unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk> cyclical <unk> and <unk> are <unk> <unk> therefore <unk> <unk> <unk> therefore <unk> and <unk> <unk> but <unk> therefore both pretty and <unk> 
 it is music for people who want to hear something different but do n't want to work especially hard at the task 
 it is <unk> listening for the now generation 
 mr. glass has <unk> the famous <unk> <unk> less is more 
 his more is always less 
 far from being <unk> the music <unk> <unk> us with apparent <unk> not so <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of N time <unk> <unk> and <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 but the music has its <unk> and mr. glass has constructed his solo program around a move from the simple to the relatively complex 
 opening N from <unk> <unk> the audience to the glass technique never <unk> too far from the piano 's center mr. glass works in the two <unk> on either side of middle c and his fingers seldom leave the <unk> 
 there is a <unk> musical style here but not a particular performance style 
 the music is not especially <unk> indeed it 's hard to imagine a bad performance of it 
 nothing <unk> no <unk> no <unk> <unk> problems challenge the performer 
 we hear we may think inner voices but they all seem to be saying the same thing 
 with planet news music meant to <unk> <unk> of allen <unk> 's wichita <unk> <unk> mr. glass gets going 
 his hands sit <unk> apart on the <unk> 
 seventh <unk> make you feel as though he may break into a very slow <unk> <unk> 
 the <unk> <unk> but there is little <unk> even though his fingers begin to <unk> over more of the <unk> 
 contrasts predictably <unk> first the music is loud then it becomes soft then you realize it becomes <unk> again 
 the fourth <unk> play an <unk> from <unk> on the beach is like a <unk> but it does n't seem to move much beyond its <unk> ground in three blind mice 
 when mr. glass decides to get really fancy he <unk> his hands and hits a <unk> bass note with his right hand 
 he does this in at least three of his solo pieces 
 you might call it a <unk> or a <unk> <unk> 
 in mad rush which came from a commission to write a piece of <unk> length mr. glass <unk> and <unk> confessed that this was no problem for me an a <unk> with a b section several times before the piece ends <unk> 
 not only is the typical <unk> <unk> it is also often multiple in its context s 
 mad rush began its life as the <unk> to the <unk> lama 's first public address in the u.s. when mr. glass played it on the <unk> at new york 's <unk> of st. john the <unk> 
 later it was performed on radio <unk> in germany and then <unk> <unk> took it for one of her dance pieces 
 the point is that any piece can be used as background music for virtually anything 
 the evening ended with mr. glass 's <unk> another multiple work 
 parts N N and N come from the <unk> of <unk> morris 's <unk> film the thin blue line and the two other parts from <unk> music to two separate <unk> of the <unk> story of the same name 
 when used as background in this way the music has an appropriate <unk> as when a <unk> phrase a <unk> minor third <unk> the seemingly endless <unk> of reports interviews and <unk> of witnesses in the morris film 
 served up as a solo however the music lacks the <unk> provided by a context within another medium 
 <unk> of mr. glass may agree with the critic richard <unk> 's sense that the N music in twelve parts is as <unk> and <unk> as the <unk> <unk> 
 but while making the obvious point that both <unk> develop variations from themes this comparison <unk> the intensely <unk> nature of mr. glass 's music 
 its supposedly <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> that makes one <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> <unk> the <unk> radical <unk> of <unk> and <unk> and what in <unk> even seems like <unk> in <unk>

 the company would n't disclose the buyer of the initial N N stake 
 proceeds of the sale expected to be completed next week would be used to repurchase as many as N million shares of honeywell stock the company said 
 honeywell said it is negotiating the sale of a second stake in <unk> but indicated it intends to hold at least N N of the joint venture 's stock long term 
 a N N stake would allow honeywell to include <unk> earnings in its results 
 honeywell previously said it intended to reduce its holding in the japanese concern as part of a restructuring plan which also calls for a reduction of <unk> on weapons sales 
 yesterday a spokeswoman said the company was pleased with our progress in that regard and hopes to provide additional details soon 
 honeywell said its defense and marine systems group incurred delays in shipping some undisclosed contracts during the third quarter resulting in lower operating profit for that business 
 overall honeywell reported earnings of $ N million or $ N a share for the three months ended oct. N compared with a loss of $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier 
 the previous period 's results included a $ N million pretax charge related to <unk> contract costs and a $ N million pretax gain on real estate sales 
 sales for the latest quarter were flat at $ N billion

 once again your editorial page <unk> the law to conform to your almost <unk> <unk> 
 in an <unk> of little <unk> to his central point about private enforcement suits by environmental groups michael s. <unk> <unk> your readers the clean water act is written upon the <unk> the <unk> rather that nothing but zero risk will do it <unk> a legal standard of zero <unk> <unk> environmental <unk> sept.

 this statement surely <unk> your editorial viewpoint that environmental protection is generally silly or excessive but it is simply wrong 
 the clean water act contains no legal standard of zero <unk> 
 it requires that <unk> of <unk> into the waters of the united states be authorized by permits that reflect the <unk> limitations developed under section N 
 whatever may be the problems with this system it <unk> reflects zero risk or zero <unk> 
 perhaps mr. <unk> was confused by congress 's <unk> statement of the national goal in section N which indeed calls for the elimination of <unk> by N no less 
 this <unk> statement was not taken seriously when enacted in N and should not now be confused with the <unk> provisions of the statute 
 thus you do the public a great <unk> when mr. <unk> suggests even <unk> that the clean water act prohibits the preparation of a <unk> and water your <unk> readers may be led to believe that nothing but chance or oversight protects them as they <unk> in the night with their <unk> and waters from the <unk> knock of the sierra club at their doors 
 robert j. <unk> 
 national geographic the <unk> u.s. magazine is attracting more readers than ever and offers the glossy <unk> pages that upscale advertisers love 
 so why did advertising pages plunge by almost N N and ad revenue by N N in the first half 
 to hear advertisers tell it the magazine just has n't kept up with the times 
 despite renewed interest by the public in such topics as the environment and the third world it has n't been able to shake its reputation as a magazine boys like to <unk> through in search of <unk> tribe women 
 worse it lagged behind competitors in offering <unk> <unk> from regional editions to discounts for frequent advertisers 
 but now the magazine is attempting to fight back with an ambitious plan including a revamped sales strategy and a surprisingly aggressive ad campaign 
 advertisers do n't think of the magazine first says joan <unk> who joined in april as national advertising director 
 what we want to do is take a more aggressive stance 
 people did n't believe we were in tune with the marketplace and in many ways we were n't 
 the <unk> magazine has never had to woo advertisers with quite so much <unk> before 
 it largely <unk> on its <unk> <unk> N million subscribers in the first half up from N million a year ago an average age of N for readers at the <unk> of their <unk> years loyalty to the tune of an N N average subscription renewal rate 
 the magazine had its best year yet in N when it <unk> its centennial and racked up a N N gain in ad pages to N 
 but this year when the <unk> surrounding its centennial died so too did some advertiser interest 
 the reason ad executives say is that the entire magazine business has been soft and national geographic has some <unk> that make it especially <unk> during a soft market 
 perhaps the biggest of those factors is its high ad prices $ N for a <unk> page vs. $ N for the <unk> a comparable publication with a far smaller circulation 
 when ad dollars are tight the high page cost is a major <unk> for advertisers who generally want to appear regularly in a publication or not at all 
 even though national geographic offers far more readers than does a magazine like <unk> the page costs you an arm and a leg to develop any frequency says harry glass new york media manager for bozell inc 
 to combat that problem national geographic like other magazines began offering regional editions allowing advertisers to appear in only a portion of its magazines for example ads can run only in the magazines sent to subscribers in the largest N markets 
 but the magazine was slower than its competitors to come up with its regional editions and until last year offered fewer of them than did competitors 
 time magazine for example has more than N separate editions going to different regions top management and other groups 
 another sticking point for advertisers was national geographic 's tradition of <unk> its ads together usually at the beginning or end of the magazine rather than spreading ads out among its articles as most magazines do 
 and national geographic 's <unk> size means extra production costs for advertisers 
 but ms. <unk> says the magazine is fighting back 
 it now offers N regional editions it very recently began running ads adjacent to articles and it has been <unk> up its sales force 
 and it just launched a promotional campaign to tell chief executives marketing directors and media executives just that 
 the centerpiece of the promotion is its new ad campaign into which the magazine will pour about $ N mostly in the next few weeks 
 the campaign created by <unk> group 's ddb needham agency takes advantage of the <unk> photography that national geographic is known for 
 in one ad a photo of the interior of the <unk> in paris is <unk> with the headline the only book more respected than <unk> does n't accept advertising 
 another ad pictures a tree <unk> magnified N times with the headline for impact far beyond your size consider our regional editions 
 ms. <unk> says she wants the campaign to help attract advertisers in N categories including corporate financial services consumer electronics insurance and food 
 her goal to top N ad pages in N up from about N this year 
 whether she can meet that ambitious goal is still far from certain 
 the ad campaign is meant to <unk> the thought of national geographic she says 
 we want it to be a <unk> kind of image

 the commodity futures trading commission plans to restrict dual trading on commodity exchanges a move almost certain to <unk> exchange officials and traders 
 the cftc said it will propose the restrictions after the release of a study that shows little economic benefit resulting from dual trading and cites problems associated with the practice 
 dual trading gives an exchange trader the right to trade both for his own account and for customers 
 the issue exploded this year after a federal bureau of investigation operation led to charges of widespread trading abuses at the chicago board of trade and chicago mercantile exchange 
 while not specifically mentioned in the fbi charges dual trading became a focus of attempts to tighten industry regulations 
 critics contend that traders were putting buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other traders ' customer orders 
 traders are likely to oppose such restrictions because dual trading provides a way to make money in slower markets where there is a shortage of customer orders 
 the exchanges contend that dual trading improves liquidity in the markets because traders can buy or sell even when they do n't have a customer order in hand 
 the exchanges say liquidity becomes a severe problem for <unk> traded contracts such as those with a long time remaining before expiration 
 the cftc may take those arguments into account by allowing exceptions to its restrictions 
 the agency did n't cite specific situations where dual trading might be allowed but smaller exchanges or contracts that need additional liquidity are expected to be among them 
 wendy <unk> the agency 's chairman told the senate agriculture committee that she expects the study to be released within two weeks and the rule changes to be completed by <unk> 
 the study by the cftc 's division of economic analysis shows that a trade is a trade a member of the study team said 
 whether a trade is done on a dual or <unk> basis the member said does n't seem to have much economic impact 
 currently most traders on commodity exchanges specialize in trading either for customer accounts which makes them brokers or for their own accounts as <unk> <unk> 
 the tests indicate that dual and <unk> traders are similar in terms of the trade executions and liquidity they provide to the market mrs. <unk> told the senate panel 
 members of congress have proposed restricting dual trading in bills to <unk> cftc operations 
 the house 's bill would prohibit dual trading in markets with daily average volume of N contracts or more <unk> those considered too difficult to track without a sophisticated computer system 
 the senate bill would force the cftc to suspend dual trading if an exchange ca n't show that its oversight system can detect <unk> abuses 
 so far one test of restricting dual trading has worked well 
 the chicago merc banned dual trading in its standard & poor 's 500-stock index futures pit in N 
 under the rules traders decide before a session begins whether they will trade for their own account or for customers 
 traders who stand on the pit 's top step where most customer orders are executed ca n't trade for themselves 
 a merc spokesman said the plan has n't made much difference in liquidity in the pit 
 it 's too soon to tell but people do n't seem to be unhappy with it he said 
 he said he would n't comment on the cftc plan until the exchange has seen the full proposal 
 but at a meeting last week tom <unk> the board of trade 's president told commodity lawyers dual trading is definitely worth saving 
 it adds something to the market 
 japanese firms push <unk> car <unk> 
 japanese luxury-car makers are trying to set strict design standards for their dealerships 
 but some dealers are negotiating <unk> terms while others decline to deal at all 
 nissan motor co. 's infiniti division likes to insist that every dealer construct and <unk> a building in a japanese style 
 specifications include a <unk> <unk> <unk> at the center of each showroom and a <unk> bridge <unk> a stream that flows into the building from outside 
 infiniti has it down to the <unk> says jay <unk> a partner at <unk> power & associates an auto research firm 
 toyota motor corp. 's lexus division also provides specifications 
 but only two-thirds of lexus dealers are <unk> new buildings according to the lexus <unk> 
 some are even coming up with their own novel designs 
 in louisville ky. for example david peterson has built a lexus dealership with the showroom on the second floor 
 yet some dealers have turned down infiniti or lexus <unk> because they were unwilling or unable to meet the design requirements 
 lee seidman of cleveland says infiniti was a bear on <unk> but at least let him <unk> an existing building without the stream 
 mr. seidman says he turned down a lexus franchise in part because the building was <unk> but very expensive 
 to head off arguments infiniti offers dealers cash bonuses and <unk> construction loans 
 <unk> device 's <unk> plays back a lesson 
 products <unk> have to be first to be winners 
 that 's the lesson offered through one case study featured in a design exhibit 
 dictaphone corp. was caught off guard in N when its main competitor <unk> office products of japan introduced a <unk> <unk> recorder half the size of standard <unk> devices 
 blocked by patent protection from following suit dictaphone decided to go a step further and cut the <unk> in half again down to the length of a <unk> 
 by N designers and engineers at dictaphone a pitney bowes subsidiary had produced a working model of a <unk> recorder 
 by N however the patent status of the <unk> <unk> had changed permitting dictaphone to develop its own competitive micro system which it did 
 marketing and sales departments then urged <unk> of the <unk> project 
 but others said <unk> should proceed 
 both were right 
 dictaphone went ahead and introduced the <unk> in N but it has n't sold well 
 to date says <unk> <unk> a dictaphone vice president it has broken even or shown a small loss 
 nevertheless the device has been successful in other ways 
 it helped dictaphone attract better engineers and it provided new technology for other company products 
 the <unk> recorder also helped transform the company 's reputation from <unk> to <unk> <unk> 
 it gave me great pride to see the inventor of the <unk> in japan look at the <unk> and shake his head and say <unk> says mr. <unk> 
 dictaphone 's <unk> recorder is one of N case studies in the <unk> design project sponsored by the design management institute of boston and harvard business school 
 the studies are on exhibit at harvard this month and will travel to chicago 's institute of design and the university of california at berkeley 
 a rake 's progress means <unk> out 
 one day carl barrett of mobile ala. was <unk> some <unk> leaves but the rake kept riding up over the <unk> 
 the harder he tried to push them into large <unk> the closer he came to breaking the rake and <unk> his back 
 so mr. barrett then vice president of the alabama <unk> association took a <unk> garden rake and taped it to the <unk> of a <unk> rake about nine inches up 
 his crude device worked the lower teeth gathered the leaves into a pile while the higher harder teeth moved the top of the pile 
 now incorporated into a <unk> rake the <unk> <unk> or <unk> also are supposed to aid in picking up leaves 
 one customer donald <unk> of mobile says the barrett rake allowed him to do his lawn in N N hours two hours less than usual 
 but other rake makers have their doubts 
 richard mason president of <unk> co. in <unk> w. va. says the barrett rake makes sense but it would be tough to explain to consumers 
 john <unk> marketing director for true <unk> corp. a subsidiary of black & decker says people do n't want to move a <unk> pile 
 they either pick it up he says or they start pulling from a fresh direction 
 odds and ends 
 no more <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> promises <unk> corp. of <unk> ind. the designer of a bed support to replace traditional <unk> 
 four <unk> steel <unk> each roughly in the shape of a <unk> are attached to the bottom of the box spring in a <unk> position 
 nearly half of u.s. consumers say they 'll pay up to N N more for packaging that can be recycled or is <unk> according to a survey commissioned by the michael peters group a design consultant 
 the pentagon is a <unk> house 
 living there for six years was really scary 
 the ghosts of the past are everywhere they are kept at bay only by feeding them vast quantities of our defense budget 
 some can be bought off relatively <unk> 
 during the korean war gen. douglas <unk> demanded and got in addition to his u.n. command in korea his own naval command in japan <unk> 
 those <unk> operations cost less than $ N billion a year and keep mac 's ghost quiet 
 that 's about all it costs to <unk> adm. erich <unk> 's ghost 
 in N <unk> and the german navy threatened to attack the panama <unk> so we created the southern command in panama 
 the southern command has grown even bigger since the war because <unk> 's ghost sometimes runs through the e ring dressed like gen. noriega 
 the command 's huge bureaucracy is needed to analyze whether leaders of coups against gen. noriega meet the war powers act 's six points cap <unk> 's seven points the intelligence committee 's N points and <unk> wilson 's N points necessary to justify u.s. support 
 so far no one has 
 the ghost of the soviet <unk> discovered in cuba back in the <unk> costs just a few hundred million the price of the caribbean command in key west that president carter created in N 
 the <unk> has n't been heard from since but we keep the staff around just in case 
 george marshall 's ghost is much more difficult to keep happy 
 we keep a lot of <unk> to him around the pentagon <unk> <unk> <unk> and such 
 the army headquarters on the third deck of the pentagon used to <unk> a lot of <unk> to him but the navy headquarters on the fourth deck made them stop it 
 you see marshall had this thing about the navy and the <unk> he wanted to make them part of the army but secretary of the navy james <unk> blocked him 
 now his ghost wo n't let up till it 's done 
 to keep him quiet we <unk> a new unified command every year or so run by the army or the air force and put more of the navy and <unk> under it 
 but we still hear him <unk> at night because the navy has a few ships left and to satisfy him the navy 's sea lift forces were given to a new air force bureaucracy in illinois its space operations to another command in colorado the <unk> to a new army bureaucracy in fort <unk> and the navy 's indian ocean and persian gulf forces to an army bureaucracy in florida 
 which brings up the worst and <unk> ghost of all the ghost of the shah of iran 
 when the shah died president carter was so scared that the shah 's ghost would blame him for <unk> him out to make way for the <unk> that he declared the carter doctrine 
 mr. carter said he would go to war to stop anyone from trying to grab iran 
 but that ghost would n't settle for words he wanted money and people lots 
 so mr. carter formed three new army divisions and gave them to a new bureaucracy in tampa called the rapid <unk> force 
 but that ghost was n't <unk> he knew the <unk> was neither rapid nor <unk> nor a force even though it cost $ N billion or $ N billion a year 
 after mr. carter was defeated in N the shah 's ghost claimed the credit and then went after president reagan and cap <unk> 
 i saw what he did to them <unk> 
 it made my <unk> dance with <unk> 
 why he used to lay in wait for cap suddenly he 'd leap from behind some <unk> of marshall onto cap 's <unk> and grab him by the <unk> and <unk> him till he <unk> up an additional $ N billion or so 
 cap added four more divisions to the army two active and two reserve two carrier groups to the navy a division equivalent to the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and a thousand tactical aircraft to the air force 
 he bought $ N billion in <unk> ships and $ N billion in <unk> and equipment to fill them and <unk> them at a new $ N billion base at diego garcia in the middle of the indian ocean 
 he dedicated all these new forces to the persian gulf 
 one night both marshall 's ghost and the shah 's ghost together caught cap and threw him to the ground 
 before they let him go he added a thousand bureaucrats to the <unk> in tampa and renamed it central command 
 he gave those bureaucrats charge of all naval operations in the persian gulf and indian ocean 
 marshall figured it would be good training for those soldiers someday maybe they would get the whole navy 
 they had fun moving the carriers around but it turned out that they had forgotten all about mine <unk> 
 but the shah still kept leaping out at cap so cap bought a hundred merchant ships more and $ N billion of <unk> <unk> <unk> etc. in order that those seven new army divisions and three marine <unk> could unload from all those new ships and aircraft and go to war in the <unk> <unk> 
 then suddenly <unk> 's ghost came to visit and said what the hell are you doing planning for a land war in asia N miles away 
 we 'd get our <unk> kicked 
 lucky for cap <unk> was <unk> and soon went away while the shah he kept coming back 
 so the u.s. found itself paying about $ N billion in <unk> to various arab <unk> for <unk> rights around the indian ocean 
 we had great success in somalia 
 but then it turned out that president <unk> <unk> was not at all a nice person and the navy pointed out that the base he promised us in <unk> had <unk> up about a hundred years ago and anyway was N miles from the mouth of the gulf 
 but who 's counting 
 still <unk> was the best we could get so we stay in bed with president <unk> 
 all these reports about him committing <unk> are probably <unk> anyway 
 but would n't you know now that we are spending <unk> of dollars and have built those new divisions and new air wings and have positioned all these ships and supplies to fight the russians in iran the russians seem to have lost interest in the whole subject 
 meanwhile congress is cutting huge chunks out of the rest of the defense budget 
 predictably some navy guys said do we still need to keep all N army divisions on active duty and all those extra <unk> aircraft without bases and all those army guys playing <unk> in tampa 
 could n't we save $ N billion or $ N billion a year by shifting that stuff to the reserves 
 and why not save the costs of a thousand bureaucrats by <unk> central command and putting responsibility for gulf naval operations back where it belongs afloat with the task force <unk> in the gulf 
 and where were all our <unk> paid indian ocean allies last year when our <unk> were being attacked 
 questions like that really stir up marshall 's ghost 
 he appeared late one night in the <unk> of the new defense secretary dick cheney 
 marshall came <unk> in like <unk> 's ghost dragging those chains of <unk> and air wings and links with arab <unk> 
 he would n't leave until mr. cheney promised to do whatever the pentagon systems analysts told him 
 so next day mr. cheney went out and did just that he canceled the <unk> navy and cut back one carrier and N <unk> 
 then he canceled production of the navy 's most important carrier aircraft the f-14 and the <unk> 
 on the other hand mr. cheney retained all those new land forces 
 marshall 's ghost is satisfied for now but he 'll be back 
 what with halloween coming and bigger defense cuts looming more and more pentagon bureaucrats are <unk> under their desks 
 they know that they can hold off the ghosts only a little while longer by cutting carriers and ships 
 then the whole thing will start to collapse just as it did in the 1970s and the ghosts and <unk> will be <unk> through the place turning people 's hair white 
 gives me the <unk> just thinking about it 
 mr. lehman a reagan navy secretary is a managing director of painewebber 
 the metal and marble lobby of centrust bank 's headquarters is <unk> than your average savings and loan 
 for one thing there is an old master on the wall samuel <unk> david a big <unk> <unk> painted by <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> 
 at the moment however the painting is a nagging reminder of the problems that have <unk> centrust and its flamboyant chairman and chief executive david l. paul 
 in an international buying spree that began barely two years ago mr. paul <unk> a collection of about N <unk> works including the <unk> at a total cost of $ N million 
 by midnight oct. N all of the paintings were supposed to have been sold off under orders from florida 's comptroller whose office <unk> the state 's s&ls 
 centrust did n't meet the deadline 
 the collection was at the heart of a <unk> plan mr. paul had in which the art was to do double duty as an investment for centrust and as <unk> for the s&l 's new office tower designed by <unk> <unk> 
 the <unk> is that the $ N million was <unk> from the funds of this federally insured institution even as centrust was losing money hand over <unk> 
 mr. paul had no right to buy art for the s&l in the first place it is n't on the comptroller 's permissible list without seeking a special <unk> which he did not do 
 besides that some of the paintings that were to grace the walls of centrust actually ended up hanging in the chairman 's estate on la <unk> <unk> off miami beach 
 last spring the comptroller 's office called a halt to mr. paul 's <unk> giving him six months to sell the paintings 
 the acquisitions officials said in a letter to mr. paul were <unk> <unk> and unauthorized 
 so far mr. paul has <unk> but three of his <unk> he wo n't say to whom 
 the comptroller 's office says it is monitoring the situation 
 though the agency could remove mr. paul it has no current intention to do that 
 it 's not like selling <unk> mr. paul says as he takes a drag on a <unk> st. <unk> cigarette 
 the last six months has established the quality of the collection 
 there 's no fire sale here 
 despite mr. paul 's characteristic <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> is finding that getting centrust florida 's largest thrift institution out of its <unk> investments is much tougher than getting into them had been 
 paintings are just part of the picture 
 although mr. paul has <unk> a $ N billion junk-bond portfolio to less than $ N million since april the high-yield debt market has plummeted 
 <unk> itself of what is left as is required of all thrift institutions by july N under the new federal s&l bailout law may well prove difficult 
 and centrust has other problems 
 late last week federal regulators ordered the thrift institution to stop paying dividends on its preferred stock a move that suggests deep concern about an institution 
 mr. paul has a plan to bring in $ N million by selling off N of centrust 's N branches but it has yet to be approved by regulators 
 it is mr. paul 's art venture however that has drawn the most attention from investors and regulators not to mention <unk> throughout the world 
 <unk> shareholders some of whom are suing say the chairman and his collection <unk> the excesses of speculation that set off the national s&l crisis 
 centrust shares have fallen sharply in price from a high of $ N in N to close yesterday at $ N 
 gallery directors meanwhile say mr. paul and others of his <unk> have left an <unk> mark on the art world and not for the better 
 collectors do n't say it 's a van <unk> anymore <unk> harry brooks the president of <unk> & co. a new york gallery 
 they say <unk> <unk> got $ N million for his so certainly $ N million is n't too much for mine 
 the great collectors we depended on such as paul mellon or norton simon have stopped buying and the new buyers are brilliant men who made money in the stock market or in takeovers and rushed into collecting 
 mr. <unk> an art dealer and <unk> sold vincent van <unk> 's <unk> at a sotheby 's auction in november N to australian businessman alan bond 
 trouble is mr. bond has yet to pay up and until he does sotheby 's has the painting under lock and key 
 when mr. paul moved in on the art market he let it be known that virtually no piece was too costly to be considered by centrust 
 he established his reputation as a <unk> in january last year at sotheby 's auction of the linda and gerald guterman collection in new york 
 there on one of his first shopping trips mr. paul picked up several paintings at stunning prices 
 he paid $ N million for instance for a still life by jan <unk> <unk> <unk> that was expected to fetch perhaps $ N 
 the price paid was a record for the artist 
 some N N of items offered at the guterman auction were sold at an average price of $ N 
 the rest were withdrawn for lack of acceptable bids 
 afterward mr. paul is said by mr. guterman to have <unk> mr. guterman the new york developer selling the collection and <unk> 
 he says he <unk> them recalls mr. guterman 
 and he tells me if you want to see your paintings you 'll have to come to my house in florida 
 mr. paul denies <unk> and <unk> 
 it 's just not true he says 
 mr. paul quickly became more aggressive in his collecting with the help of george wachter a sotheby 's expert in old masters whom he met at an exhibition of the guterman items 
 mr. wachter who became his principal adviser searched <unk> in london paris and <unk> 
 and according to one dealer mr. wachter had a <unk> for introducing mr. paul with the phrase he can buy anything 
 nicholas hall the president of the <unk> u.s.a. ltd. gallery in new york sold mr. paul <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> by giovanni <unk> <unk> 
 mr. hall says mr. paul was known to spend a lot of money 
 people were interested in seeing him but it was recognized that the route was through sotheby 's and particularly george wachter 
 mr. paul thus developed a close <unk> relationship with sotheby 's 
 mr. paul was eager to <unk> a collection for the headquarters centrust has been moving into for the greater part of a year 
 sotheby 's the auction house founded in london N and now under the <unk> of sotheby 's holdings inc. was hoping to stir up interest in old masters as it <unk> to build its u.s. business 
 european dealers continued to dominate the action in old masters which sotheby 's north america had lately been touting in this country 
 for several months there was optimism all around 
 last october mr. paul paid out $ N million of centrust 's cash plus a $ N million commission for portrait of a man as <unk> 
 the painting attributed to <unk> artist peter paul rubens was purchased privately through sotheby 's not at auction 
 in march N just N months into his campaign mr. paul was named by art & <unk> magazine as one of the top N individual collectors in the u.s. 
 an unknown quantity to most of the art world paul is no <unk> to <unk> spending the magazine said noting that he does n't stop at <unk> on <unk> but also spends big on art you can eat 
 he recently bid $ N at a paris charity auction for a dinner <unk> by six of the world 's great chefs but the final party cost closer to $ N 
 mr. paul says it was n't that high 
 the art collection might have come to rival the <unk> ' had the florida comptroller 's office not got wind of mr. paul 's <unk> <unk> 
 in its letter to him dated march N and shared with reporters alex <unk> the chief of the <unk> bureau in the comptroller 's office expressed <unk> that the s&l could be so <unk> when it had reported losses of more than $ N million in its two preceding quarters 
 the state gave centrust N days to sell the rubens 
 the comptroller 's office eventually extended the deadline to six months but <unk> its demands ordering that the book value of the collection be reduced to zero 
 in other words get rid of all the pictures 
 the state <unk> noted that <unk> banking practices are grounds for removing an officer or director and closed with the <unk> to mr. paul govern yourself <unk> 
 the state agency was particularly <unk> to learn that the rubens and a <unk> other paintings listed among the bank 's furniture and <unk> were actually hanging in the chairman 's house 
 mr. paul says that at one point he did indeed have eight or nine of the paintings at home and that the rest were in storage at sotheby 's 
 he explains that he was merely <unk> the paintings at home with some display because of the special <unk> environment required for their <unk> until centrust 's new building was ready for them 
 still the incident was embarrassing 
 it came on the heels of a number of local newspaper articles suggesting that mr. paul has benefited <unk> from his association with centrust 
 for instance he got a $ N million loan from the s&l negotiated at a <unk> rate 
 he owns N N of centrust 's shares 
 adding to mr. paul 's problems dealers some with vested interests insist that he relying rather too heavily on sotheby 's advice paid much too much for several pieces in the centrust collection 
 the $ N million <unk> on the rubens for example was a record price for the artist and maybe twice its value given a dispute among scholars about its <unk> 
 david <unk> the president of david <unk> inc. a new york gallery says scholars question the <unk> of the rubens 
 it may have been painted instead by a rubens associate 
 the feeling among many experts on the commercial side is that the price paid at the time was excessive in any event mr. <unk> says 
 it sounds like with the rubens he got absolutely taken to the <unk> 
 victor <unk> the executive director of the <unk> association of america agrees that mr. paul paid very <unk> for the rubens and adds that getting rid of it any time soon for a similar sum would be quite a feat 
 it 's not beyond credibility the rubens will someday be worth $ N million but whether it could be sold for that amount tomorrow remains to be seen 
 still predicting is tricky 
 i 'm forever <unk> by what i see making these high prices 
 jonathan h. <unk> the son of the painting 's former owner mrs. rush <unk> <unk> the price talk as sour <unk> 
 dealers <unk> of the purchase price he says were themselves interested in buying the rubens but lost out 
 mr. paul for his part <unk> the rubens price saying a lot of the experts have never seen the thing itself 
 most of them were n't even born the last time the painting was displayed publicly he says 
 art prices are <unk> but a good deal of <unk> is involved in <unk> statistics on sales 
 salomon brothers inc. the investment-banking firm in its annual tally of investment returns reported that old masters <unk> N N in the year ended june N the greatest return of any of N assets it tracked 
 <unk> and modern paintings not tracked by salomon are ranked even higher at N N by sotheby 's 
 salomon moreover gets its data on art appreciation from sotheby 's whose prices go up with clients like mr. paul in its <unk> 
 the <unk> <unk> from consideration the many paintings that go <unk> at auction 
 art indexes track winners not losers 
 but art that has fallen sharply in value is rarely put up for sale 
 also at any of sotheby 's auctions of old masters roughly one-third to <unk> of what is offered does n't sell at any price 
 it 's not that there are n't any bids but the bids do n't meet the minimum reserve prices set by the sellers 
 in january the <unk> painting that now hangs at centrust was expected to bring no more than $ N at auction until mr. paul came along with his $ N million 
 mr. hall of the <unk> gallery says $ N million would have been an impossible price for anyone to ask for a <unk> four years ago 
 but from his <unk> point it is n't that mr. paul a customer of his too <unk> for the work a <unk> painting by an artist who is not a household word 
 the painting is N feet wide seven feet high 
 rather it just shows things have changed 
 mr. paul boasts that he spotted bargains in old masters just before they took an upward turn 
 they went up N N last year and they 'll do it again this year he declares 
 they were a <unk> 
 everybody was out buying <unk> 
 sotheby 's vice president <unk> <unk> says the auction house has been <unk> mr. paul in selling the paintings 
 and while sotheby 's chief rivals in the art world private art dealers wo n't be happy to hear it she adds a number of the <unk> have already been sold and at a substantial profit 
 mr. paul claims to have sold three paintings at more than a N N profit 
 that is n't N N and the claim is n't <unk> 
 he furthermore denies that he relied too heavily on sotheby 's or mr. wachter 
 mr. paul says he had not one but four advisers and that he never bid <unk> 
 after all he had the counsel of <unk> from the most reputable <unk> in the world 
 he says he expects to sell the collection including the controversial rubens carefully and <unk> just as it was put together 
 but in <unk> <unk> mr. paul 's holdings are <unk> 
 that is he is being <unk> to put them on the market too soon and has already gotten offers that are less than he paid for some of the art works 
 after a few years you can argue there has been natural appreciation says susan <unk> the publisher of leonard 's annual price index of art auctions 
 but quick turnover in <unk> is like <unk> your jewelry you end up with N N 
 people hold out and try to get a bargain 
 sotheby 's <unk> itself and mr. paul in the matter 
 mr. wachter says mr. paul was a quick study who worked intensely and bought the best pictures available at the moment 
 on occasion he paid a high price mr. wachter concedes but he says those who bid less and dropped out were dealers who would then have marked up the paintings to <unk> them at a profit to collectors 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> at <unk> associates in san francisco considers it <unk> conflict of interest for an auction house to both advise a client on purchases and to set price estimates on the paintings to be purchased 
 sotheby 's she says is wearing both hats 
 i ca n't see why there would be a conflict of interest says sotheby 's ms. <unk> 
 estimates are based on the previous price of similar works sold at auction and current market conditions and are not affected by any knowledge of who the potential buyer could be 
 frequently clients express interest in paintings but do n't end up bidding she adds so we do n't know who the potential buyer will be 
 mr. paul in selling off his paintings is seeking at least a N N return on the bank 's investment so as to prove that the venture was sound 
 mr. paul says that he has <unk> out over much of the globe and that potential buyers from as far away as japan and italy have examined the collection 
 because of the pressure on centrust to sell dealers and collectors have been trying to get the paintings at <unk> prices 
 but so far mr. paul and his advisers are holding fast 
 one dealer martin <unk> of french & co. in new york says he would have loved to buy a jan <unk> de <unk> painting from the bank 
 i tried to steal the picture to buy it <unk> and sotheby 's would n't do it 
 they were protecting his interests 
 meanwhile mr. paul and centrust executives are getting <unk> about <unk> 
 mr. paul has been characterized as the great <unk> or something complains karen e. <unk> an executive vice president of centrust 
 the media she says have distorted his personal life 
 mr. paul <unk> in agreement 
 i do n't think i have a life style that is frankly so flamboyant he says 
 but at just that moment he is interrupted in his office by a <unk> in <unk> who <unk> coffee from silver into a cup of china and <unk> the <unk> with <unk> 
 mr. paul says yes the ceiling in his executive <unk> is <unk> <unk> 
 the offices are done in <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> books and of course a $ N million rubens 
 but he <unk> that the <unk> be played down 
 do n't say it 's a gold ceiling 
 just say the offices are <unk> appointed he says 
 otherwise the regulators will take it for <unk> and <unk> everything 's got to be <unk> 
 figures do n't include taxes or transaction costs 
 companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts ' estimates

 creative accounting mostly by <unk> forced <unk> to change their way of setting standards to be followed by corporations reporting financial results standards that had become all too flexible 
 the new financial accounting standards board fasb was created in N to replace the accounting principles board of the american institute of certified public accountants 
 all of the former board 's members were <unk> <unk> <unk> criticism because they were writing rules while handling clients ' books at the same time

 the former board had produced N opinions and N critics in its 12-year life its chairman had conceded 
 the climate was right for the new fasb 
 in the late 1960s some <unk> failed to correct such abuses as clients picking <unk> rules that <unk> earnings and stock prices 
 and in november N congress had passed a special act to <unk> one board rule 
 also james needham an sec commissioner in april N had warned that the industry might face a federal agency writing accounting rules if they rejected the fasb idea

 the turmoil on wall street may benefit some retailers attempting to lead leveraged buy-outs of their specialty and department-store chains investment bankers and retailers said 
 managers at five chains have said in recent weeks that they intend to bid for their companies 
 the chains include bloomingdale 's owned by campeau corp. toronto saks fifth avenue and marshall field 's owned by b.a.t industries plc london and b. altman & co. and <unk> inc. owned by hooker corp. which is now being managed by a court-appointed provisional <unk> 
 hooker is based in sydney australia 
 the combination of so many chains available for sale the recent failures of such retailing lbo 's as miller & <unk> inc. and declining investor confidence will drive down prices retailing observers said 
 the pricing will become more realistic which should help management said bruce rosenthal a new york investment banker with nathan s. <unk> & co 
 investors are n't going to be throwing money at any of the proposed lbos but doing deals on the basis of ridiculous assumptions never made sense either 
 earlier this year bankers and other investors were willing to provide financing because they assumed there would be major gains in both profitability and sales mr. rosenthal added 
 those days are over now he believes 
 competition from third parties who have cash and are prepared to buy has always existed and will continue added mr. rosenthal 
 but when prices were crazy it was even harder to do an lbo 
 bankers believed in the <unk> theory that says somebody else is always willing to pay more 
 this is no longer true today 
 at saks fifth avenue paul <unk> senior vice president marketing agreed that lower prices will help his management team in their proposed lbo 
 having to take on less debt would certainly be an advantage said mr. <unk> 
 it would also help us in our search for equity partners 
 to make an lbo work now we are going to need more than just junk bonds 
 none believe the proposed management lbos will be easy to complete especially at b. altman & co. which is under chapter N bankruptcy protection 
 not only could the wall street gyrations damp christmas sales if consumers lose confidence in the economy but potential junk-bond buyers are sure to demand even stronger <unk> and greater management equity participation 
 further many institutions today holding troubled retailers ' debt securities will be <unk> to consider additional retailing investments 
 it 's called bad money driving out good money said one retailing <unk> 
 institutions that usually buy retail paper have to be more concerned 
 however the lower prices these retail chains are now expected to bring should make it easier for managers to raise the necessary capital and pay back the resulting debt 
 in addition the fall selling season has generally been a good one especially for those retailers dependent on apparel sales for the majority of their revenues 
 what 's encouraging about this is that retail chains will be sold on the basis of their sales and earnings not liquidation values said joseph e. brooks chairman and chief executive officer of ann taylor inc. a specialty chain 
 retailers who had good track records of producing profits will have a better chance to buy back their companies 
 still most retailing observers expect that all the proposed retailing lbos will depend partly on the sale of junk bonds a market already in <unk> in part because of concerns associated with bonds issued by the federated and allied units of campeau 
 prices for retail chains are lower today than they were last week which will help management said <unk> harrison chairman of <unk> inc. an investment-banking firm specializing in retailing acquisitions 
 but the hurdle of financing still has to be resolved 
 potential bondholders will either look for greater equity participation on behalf of management or insist the equity component of the deals be substantially greater than in the past

 a federal appeals court struck down a natural-gas regulation that had prevented pipeline companies from passing to customers part of $ N billion in costs from controversial <unk> contracts 
 the court in a N ruling threw out a deadline set by the federal energy regulatory commission for settling old contract disputes over gas that the pipeline companies reserved but did n't use 
 ferc 's regulation had given pipelines until march N N to pass on to customers as much as N N of the costs of buying out their broken contracts which were made with producers when gas prices were high and supplies short 
 a majority of old contracts were <unk> by the deadline and settled at steep discounts 
 but pipeline companies estimate they still face $ N billion in liabilities from <unk> disputes including $ N billion they fear they wo n't be able to pass on to customers 
 according to industry lawyers the ruling gives pipeline companies an important second chance to resolve remaining disputes and take advantage of the cost-sharing mechanism 
 the court left open whether ferc could <unk> a new deadline later 
 the court agreeing with pipeline companies found the march N deadline was <unk> and <unk> and highly <unk> to the bargaining power of pipelines that were forced to negotiate settlement of the old <unk> contracts to meet the deadline

 south korean consumers are expected to buy almost N passenger cars this year up N N from N 
 in fact some auto executives suggest that <unk> demand for their cars in the u.s. and canada is a blessing otherwise they would n't be able to keep up with demand in the more profitable local market 
 we are very lucky to easily change an export loss to domestic plus says hong <unk> <unk> managing director of domestic marketing for hyundai motor co 
 as it is waiting lists of a month are n't unusual for popular models 
 demand is so strong that all of the domestic makers hyundai kia motors corp. daewoo motor co. and even <unk> ssangyong motor co. plan to build more factories 
 industry analysts predict that by N south korea will be building three million cars a year about half of that for export 
 it 's an optimistic move in a industry already facing world-wide overcapacity 
 but south korean auto makers are confident that the export market will bounce back and that demand in korea will stay strong 
 currently only one in N south koreans owns a car up from one in N a decade ago 
 in the year N it will be one car per family 
 at that point domestic sales will slow down says kim <unk> <unk> director of marketing for daewoo motor

 many <unk> mutual fund investors picked up the phone yesterday but decided not to cash in their chips after all 
 as the stock market bounced back withdrawals of money from stock funds amounted to a mere <unk> compared with black monday when investors dumped $ N billion or about N N of <unk> assets 
 fidelity investments the nation 's largest fund company said phone volume was more than double its typical level but still half that of oct. N N 
 net outflows from fidelity 's stock funds stood at less than $ N million or below N N of the $ N billion cash position of the firm 's stock portfolios 
 much of the money was switched into the firm 's money market funds 
 outflows since the close of trading friday remain below one-third their level of two years ago fidelity said 
 other mutual fund companies reported even lighter withdrawal requests 
 and some investors at fidelity and elsewhere even began buying stock funds during the day 
 two years ago there was a lot of redemption activity and trouble with people getting through on the phone said <unk> <unk> head of the investment management division of the securities and exchange commission 
 this time we do n't have that at all 
 of course the relative calm could be jolted if the market <unk> again 
 and any strong surge in redemptions could force some funds to dump stocks to raise cash as some did during black monday 
 but funds generally are better prepared this time around 
 as a group their cash position of N N of assets in august the latest figure available is N N higher than two years earlier 
 many fund managers have boosted their cash levels in recent weeks 
 the biggest flurry of investor activity came early in the day 
 vanguard group inc. saw heavy exchanges from stock funds into money market funds after the telephone lines opened at N a.m 
 in the first hour the real nervous folks came along a spokesman said 
 but the <unk> pace of call volume in the first half-hour slowed considerably 
 at <unk> stevens & clark inc. phone calls came in at N N more than the normal pace through early afternoon 
 most of that increase came in the first hour after the phone lines opened at N a.m 
 as stocks rose in fact some investors changed course and reversed their sell orders 
 many funds allow investors to <unk> orders before the close of trading 
 at <unk> and at the smaller ivy funds group in <unk> mass. for instance some shareholders called early in the morning to switch money from stock funds to money market funds but later called back to reverse the switches 
 because mutual fund trades do n't take effect until the market close in this case at N p.m. these shareholders effectively stayed put 
 at fidelity 's office in downtown boston gerald sherman walked in shortly after N a.m. and placed an order to switch his retirement accounts out of three stock funds and into a money market fund 
 but by N p.m. with the market <unk> ahead for the day mr. sherman was preparing to undo his switch 
 it 's a nice feeling to know that things stabilized said mr. sherman the <unk> <unk> of a discount department store 
 but some investors continued to switch out of high-risk high-yield junk funds despite yesterday 's rebound from that market 's recent price declines 
 shareholders have been steadily <unk> out of several big junk funds the past several weeks as the $ N billion market was jolted by a cash crunch at campeau corp. and steadily declining prices 
 much of the money has been switched into money market funds fund executives say 
 instead of selling bonds to meet redemptions however some funds have borrowed from banks to meet withdrawal requests 
 this <unk> knocking down prices further 
 the $ N billion t. rowe price high yield fund was among the funds that borrowed during the campeau crisis says george j. collins president of t. rowe price associates inc 
 that way mr. collins says we did n't have to sell securities in a sloppy market

 the roller-coaster stock market is making life tougher for small companies trying to raise money 
 in the wake of friday 's plunge and yesterday 's rebound some companies are already <unk> deals and others wish they could 
 as in other jittery times many small businesses expect a particularly rough time raising funds as investors <unk> risky deals seeking safety in bigger companies 
 even if stock prices fully recover from friday 's sharp decline the unsettled conditions will <unk> many investors 
 the implication of an unsettled situation is that the thing could drop dramatically says henry <unk> jr. chairman of <unk> corp. a four-year-old biotechnology company that is planning a private placement of stock 
 the more <unk> that indicate risk the more the investor is going to drive a hard bargain 
 earlier this month <unk> inc. a <unk> mass. <unk> <unk> said it would accelerate expansion plans nationwide and offer more of its stock to the public 
 at the time its shares were selling above their initial offering price of $ N and bankers believed <unk> would sell new stock without a <unk> 
 but with the company 's shares standing at $ N yesterday a new offering seems unlikely company officials say 
 business however continues to be robust and the stock market has n't affected the concern 's expansion plans says <unk> <unk> a senior executive 
 other companies figure they ca n't avoid the market 
 we have capital requirements says mr. <unk> so we have to go ahead with a planned $ N billion private placement 
 unless the market goes right back up he says it may take us six to nine months to find the money instead of three

 as the market dropped friday robertson <unk> slashed the value of the offering by N N 
 yesterday when similar securities rebounded it <unk> the valuation up again 
 as of late yesterday the ipo was still on

 mr. <unk> thinks rates are heading down helping small companies 
 peter <unk> biotechnology analyst for <unk> securities international chicago thinks market uncertainty may encourage small companies to form more strategic alliances with big corporations 
 partly because the N market crash made it harder for them to find financing many high-technology concerns have made such alliances recently

 bay financial corp. hurt by high debts and deteriorating real estate investments reported a wider loss for the fourth quarter and said it might be forced to seek a bankruptcy-court reorganization if it ca n't <unk> its borrowings 
 bay said a substantial part of its debt outstanding is in default as a result of inability to sell certain properties quickly and lower-than-expected prices for sales made 
 the company said its real estate portfolio is highly leveraged while about two-thirds of its investments are n't <unk> 
 thus it is coming up short on a big bet that quick sales at higher prices would enable it to keep up with mortgage and other debt payments 
 according to its latest annual report about a quarter of the company 's holdings are in massachusetts in the midst of a real-estate slump 
 the company said it had a net loss in its fourth quarter ended june N of $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N million 
 a year earlier the company had a loss of $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N million 
 for the year it had a net loss of $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N million 
 in the previous year it had a loss of $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N million 
 although it is having serious <unk> problems bay said the <unk> value of its holdings minus debt was equal to $ N a share at june N based on a recent <unk> 
 book value per share which is based on investments at cost was a negative $ N a share 
 a year earlier <unk> value per share was $ N and book value was $ N a share

 <unk> inc. reported a N N decline in third-quarter net income but the company said that excluding unusual gains in both quarters operating profit rose N N 
 the electronics automotive and aerospace concern said third-quarter net was $ N million or N cents a share down from $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier 
 share earnings are reported on a fully diluted basis by company tradition 
 results for the N quarter included a gain of $ N a share from sale of the <unk> pump and <unk> cable units partly offset by a charge of N cents a share for recall of <unk> truck steering systems 
 the latest quarter included a gain of N cents a share as a partial reversal of the recall charge because the reserve established last year exceeded the actual recall costs 
 sales for the quarter rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion with all three major product groups reporting gains 
 the company said aerospace and defense sales were up N N for the quarter to $ N million and operating profit climbed N N to $ N million mainly because of improved program performance in spacecraft and <unk> contracts 
 automotive sales jumped N N to $ N million mainly because of higher sales of air bags and other passenger restraint systems <unk> said 
 the group had an operating profit of $ N million against a loss of $ N million a year earlier 
 however excluding the year-earlier charge for recall of steering gear operating profit in the latest quarter declined N N reflecting higher start-up and product development expenses in <unk> systems 
 materials and production costs also rose <unk> said 
 the information systems segment had a N N jump sales to $ N million 
 an acquisition accounted for half the sales rise <unk> said 
 operating profit rose <unk> to $ N million from $ N million 
 for the nine months <unk> 's net was $ N million or $ N a share down N N from $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier

 in fact <unk> <unk> 's the remains of the day <unk> N pages $ N is both an <unk> to traditional english forms and a dramatic <unk> of them 
 it implies that the british empire was rooted in its subjects ' minds <unk> and <unk> and argues <unk> that its <unk> flaws were <unk> in the defensive <unk> willful <unk> <unk> and especially the <unk> of its domestic <unk> 
 as the <unk> stevens the <unk> butler of <unk> hall <unk> over such <unk> terms as <unk> dignity service and loyalty we see how <unk> <unk> <unk> the soul 
 stevens 's <unk> <unk> of the public and private <unk> like his <unk> master 's <unk> all it was designed to preserve 
 such <unk> <unk> the <unk> 
 the <unk> cuts to the quick 
 it 's N the year the suez crisis marked the final end of empire 
 as he stands on a hill at the beginning of a <unk> motor <unk> from <unk> to <unk> where a former <unk> <unk> perhaps the victim of an unhappy 20-year marriage perhaps he hopes with more <unk> than he will ever acknowledge not <unk> to return to domestic service stevens surveys the view and thereby provides a <unk> a <unk> and the author 's <unk> for the <unk> of the novel we 're reading 
 we call this land of <unk> great britain and there may be those who believe this a somewhat <unk> practice 
 yet i would venture that the landscape of our country alone would justify the use of this <unk> <unk> 
 it is the very lack of obvious drama or <unk> that sets the beauty of our land apart 
 what is <unk> is the <unk> of that beauty its sense of restraint 
 it is as though the land knows of its own beauty of its own <unk> and feels no need to <unk> it 
 in comparison the sorts of sights offered in such places as africa and america though undoubtedly very exciting would i am sure strike the objective <unk> as <unk> on account of their <unk> <unk> 
 an <unk> landscape 
 an <unk> mountain 
 but let stevens continue in his <unk> comic manner his <unk> efforts at <unk> always fail most <unk> this whole question is very <unk> to the question that has caused much debate in our profession over the years what is a great butler 
 his answer is one <unk> of a dignity in keeping with his position 
 such dignity has to do <unk> with a butler 's ability not to abandon the professional being he <unk> 
 he will not be shaken out by external events however surprising <unk> or <unk> 
 <unk> are unable to be <unk> because they are as a breed <unk> of the emotional restraint which only the english race are capable of 
 despite his racial advantage to be a great butler is a <unk> calling one 's <unk> is not unlike general 's headquarters during a battle 
 if for example in the midst of a great social occasion such as an international conference on <unk> the <unk> treaty in N one 's <unk> father himself a great butler once should happen to die of a <unk> one must continue to serve the port please do n't think me <unk> improper in not <unk> to see my father in his <unk> condition just at this moment 
 you see i know my father would have <unk> me to carry on just now 
 it is this kind of dignity and restraint that allows stevens to declare for all its sad associations whenever i recall that evening today i find i do so with a large sense of <unk> 
 we note the imperial public word used to deny private rage and <unk> 
 that stevens himself is not <unk> or <unk> but funny and sad and <unk> is entirely the author 's <unk> 
 mr. <unk> 's ability to create a <unk> <unk> voice that permits him to explore such <unk> domestic cultural and political themes was <unk> clear in his previous novel an artist of the floating world set in japan after the war 
 now shifting his scene from the country he left at five to the england he has lived in for nearly N years he has <unk> a novel in the mode of henry james and <unk> <unk> 
 with great <unk> he considers not only <unk> <unk> and utterly <unk> sexual love but british <unk> the <unk> 's <unk> with democracy and support of <unk> and the moral <unk> of loyalty it is in practice simply not possible to adopt such a critical attitude <unk> an employer and at the same time provide good service 
 this employer <unk> all that i find noble and <unk> 
 i will <unk> devote myself to serving him 
 this is loyalty <unk> <unk> 
 in the end after meeting with the former <unk> stevens sits by the <unk> at <unk> thinking of her and of his employer and declares i trusted 
 i trusted in his <unk> 's wisdom 
 i ca n't even say i made my own mistakes 
 really one has to ask <unk> what dignity is there in that 
 the loyal <unk> has come full circle 
 what is <unk> 
 what is dignity 
 we understand such <unk> wisdom must be <unk> the <unk> of <unk> only spreads her wings at <unk> 
 but as the remains of the day so <unk> demonstrates with quiet <unk> such wisdom can be <unk> <unk> in art

 <unk> <unk> who represents the soviet airline aeroflot here has some <unk> that are wild even by the current standards of perestroika 
 in his office <unk> the runway of shannon airport mr. <unk> <unk> throws out what he calls just ideas 
 first he suggests <unk> group ltd. the international aircraft leasing company based in ireland could lease some of its boeing <unk> to the soviet airline 
 then aer <unk> the irish flag carrier could teach aeroflot pilots to fly the <unk> and the fleet could be based here at shannon airport 
 that 's not all he says 
 aer <unk> the irish airport authority could build a cargo terminal in the soviet union 
 aeroflot could lease some of its cargo planes to aer <unk> through <unk> for a joint-venture cargo airline 
 and then there is his notion of an <unk> charter airline to ferry <unk> to los angeles via shannon 
 have the freedoms of glasnost gone to mr. <unk> 's head 
 hardly 
 the <unk> aviation connection is alive and well here at shannon airport 
 <unk> is indeed talking about leasing western planes to aeroflot and even about buying <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 aer <unk> is in discussions with the soviet carrier about a cargo venture and other possibilities 
 aer <unk> already has so many ventures with aeroflot that its chief executive is studying russian 
 unlikely as it may seem tiny politically neutral ireland has <unk> the mighty soviet airline bureaucracy 
 and as aeroflot struggles to boost its service standards upgrade its fleet and pursue commercial opportunities the irish aviation industry seems poised to benefit 
 irish and soviet people are similar says mr. <unk> 
 they look the same 
 they 're very friendly 
 moreover he says irish companies are small but <unk> 
 we have to study their experience very well he says 
 we must find any way to get business 
 the two groups have been working together since the late 1970s long before soviet joint ventures were the rage in the west 
 aeroflot carried about N million passengers last year and shannon airport the airline 's largest transit airport outside the soviet union saw N aeroflot flights and N passengers pass through 
 an apartment complex down the road is the <unk> and staging area for more than N aeroflot pilots and flight attendants 
 the airport 's biggest supplier of aircraft fuel is the soviet union 
 <unk> from the <unk> port of <unk> each year unload N million gallons of fuel into a special tank farm at the airport 
 what aeroflot does n't pour into its own <unk> <unk> is <unk> to the airport authority which <unk> it to N western carriers including air france trans world airlines and pakistan international airlines 
 aeroflot thus pays its landing fees <unk> and <unk> bills with fuel preserving its hard currency 
 that is n't all 
 last year the irish airport authority in a joint venture with aeroflot opened four <unk> duty-free shops at moscow 's <unk> airport 
 aer <unk> now manages duty-free sales on all aeroflot international flights out of moscow 
 duty-free shops in <unk> 's <unk> airport opened in july and <unk> shops in <unk> hotels and on the <unk> <unk> are coming soon 
 aer <unk> is talking about similar joint ventures in <unk> and in <unk> a black sea resort and even has a <unk> project cooking with the <unk> city of <unk> 
 aeroflot 's international fleet of N planes is being <unk> and <unk> at shannon airport 
 thanks to a new <unk> agreement and the ability of irish travel agents to issue aeroflot tickets tourists here are taking advantage of aeroflot 's reasonable prices to board flights in shannon for holidays in <unk> <unk> and mexico city 
 the <unk> fare to <unk> is N irish punts $ N 
 jamaica costs N punts 
 a formal blessing of sorts was <unk> on this friendship in april when mikhail and <unk> gorbachev stopped here for talks with irish prime minister charles <unk> 
 new trade accords were signed 
 it all started with geography 
 when it opened in N shannon was the first <unk> in europe for <unk> airplanes flying from north america 
 advances in aircraft fuel efficiency over the years made a shannon stop unnecessary for most western air fleets but aeroflot still flies inefficient <unk> that ca n't make it from moscow to managua on one <unk> 
 as a result ireland did n't <unk> the soviets after they shot down a korean air lines jetliner over the sea of japan in N though it suspended direct <unk> flights for two months 
 in fact aer <unk> started <unk> russians from shannon to new york when washington stripped aeroflot of its u.s. landing rights 
 today aer <unk> is making a <unk> of money from its soviet friendship 
 and with those contacts in place it could be relatively simple to add aer <unk> and <unk> to the team 
 then perhaps mr. <unk> 's ideas would n't sound like so much <unk> 
 britain 's industrial production rose N N in august from july and was up N N from august N according to provisional data from the central statistical office

 when <unk> corp. begins shipping steel from the world 's first <unk> plant this month it will begin testing the competitive <unk> of its giant competitors 
 the new technology which creates a very thin piece of steel <unk> reduces the costs of making flat-rolled sheets 
 an <unk> kenneth iverson <unk> 's chairman says the company 's plant eventually will make a ton of steel in N man hours compared with four to six man hours at a conventional mill 
 we 've had the russians and chinese and people from india visiting us mr. iverson <unk> 
 everyone in the world is watching us very closely 
 especially his neighbors the major u.s. steelmakers 
 already usx corp. and armco inc. are studying <unk> 's technology to see if they can adopt it 
 says the chief executive officer of a major midwest steel company it 's damn worrisome 
 the <unk> steel industry is about to be turned <unk> by a 1990s technology revolution 
 new efficient and sophisticated processes make it easier for smaller less <unk> companies to make steel at a fraction of what big steel paid decades ago 
 it also enables minimills finally to get a <unk> in the flat-rolled steel market the major steelmakers ' largest most <unk> and until now <unk> market 
 but such <unk> technology is only the beginning 
 eager engineers <unk> <unk> and direct casting which by the end of the 1990s will enable production without coke <unk> and blast <unk> 
 those massive structures while <unk> cost and environmental headaches effectively locked out all but <unk> giants from <unk> 
 there 's a revolution ahead of us that will ultimately change the way we market and distribute steel says william dennis vice president manufacturing and technology for the american iron <unk> and steel institute 
 it is n't that major steelmakers have <unk> ignored high technology 
 in fact they 've spent billions of dollars to boost the percentage of <unk> cast steel to N N in N from N N five years before 
 moreover their balance sheets are rich with diversity their old plants <unk> and work forces lean 
 but that wo n't <unk> 
 it 's no longer enough to beat the guy down the street 
 you have to beat everyone around the world says mr. dennis 
 he wants to see steelmakers more involved in computers and <unk> intelligence 
 the problem they 're <unk> with huge plants that require costly maintenance 
 and try <unk> new dollars free in a market that is softening hurt by a strong dollar and concerned about overcapacity the industry 's <unk> <unk> 
 the technology revolution is going to be very threatening to established producers says peter marcus an analyst with painewebber inc 
 they 've got too much invested in the old stuff and they ca n't get their workers to be flexible 
 no one expects minimills to <unk> major integrated steelmakers who remain the <unk> <unk> of <unk> steel used for autos and refrigerators 
 <unk> 's plant in <unk> ind. ultimately will produce only one million tons annually a drop in the <unk> flat-rolled steel <unk> and it will be years before such plants can compete in the <unk> market 
 still flat-rolled is the steel industry 's bread and butter representing about half of the N million tons of steel expected to be shipped this year 
 moreover the process is n't without its headaches 
 because all operations are connected one equipment failure forces a complete plant shutdown 
 on some days the <unk> plant does n't produce anything 
 at this point the <unk> capacity wo n't make a great <unk> in the integrated market but it does challenge them to develop new markets says james mccall vice president materials at <unk> a technology and <unk> giant based in columbus ohio 
 indeed with demand for steel not growing fast enough to absorb capacity steelmakers will have to change the way they do business 
 in the past says armco 's chief economist john <unk> steelmakers made a product and set it out on the <unk> <unk> 
 we said we 've got a product if you want it you can buy it he says adding now we 're figuring out what people need and are going back to make it 
 armco 's sales representatives visit the general motors corp. 's <unk> assembly plant in kansas city mo. two or three days a week 
 when they determined that gm needed parts more quickly armco convinced a steel service center to build a processing plant nearby so shipments could be delivered within N minutes 
 <unk> such relationships with major clients car and <unk> makers is a means of survival especially when those key clients are relying on a smaller pool of producers and <unk> with plastic and aluminum makers 
 for example when detroit began talking about <unk> cars the american iron and steel institute began a major lobbying effort to show auto makers how they could use steel more efficiently by simply <unk> how a car door is assembled 
 but steelmakers must also find new markets 
 after letting <unk> take the recycling lead a group of the nation 's largest steelmakers started a recycling institute to promote steel cans to an environmentally <unk> nation 
 <unk> 's mr. mccall thinks steelmakers should concentrate more on construction 
 weirton steel corp. weirton w. va. for example is touting to homeowners fashionable steel doors with <unk> glass <unk> as a secure and <unk> alternative to wooden or aluminum ones 
 other steelmakers <unk> steel <unk> covering <unk> 
 still others are looking at overseas markets 
 usx is <unk> drilling pipe to <unk> soviet union 
 this year the nation 's largest steelmaker <unk> its overseas sales operation 
 producers also are trying to <unk> by concentrating on <unk> output such as coated and <unk> products which remain beyond the reach of minimills 
 almost all <unk> programs announced by major steelmakers within the past year involve building <unk> lines used to produce steel for such products as household appliances and car doors 
 but unfortunately that segment is much smaller than the bread-and-butter flat-rolled steel 
 it 's like everyone climbing out of the <unk> ii and getting into a <unk> says john jacobson an analyst with <unk> consultants 
 after a while someone has to go over the side 
 although he does n't expect any <unk> he does see more plants being sold or closed 
 robert crandall with the <unk> institute agrees 
 unless there is an enormous rate of economic growth or a further drop in the dollar it 's unlikely that consumption of u.s. produced steel will grow sufficiently to offset the growth of minimills 
 not to mention the <unk> of imports 
 japanese and european steelmakers which have led the recent technology developments are <unk> awaiting the lifting of trade restraints in N 
 moreover the u.s. can expect more competition from low-cost producing pacific <unk> and latin american countries 
 a taiwanese steelmaker recently announced plans to build a <unk> plant 
 people think of the steel business as an old and mundane <unk> business says mr. iverson 
 they 're dead wrong

 polaroid corp. 's <unk> damages case against eastman kodak co. one of the highest stakes corporate trials ever is getting <unk> attention on wall street 
 after N days of <unk> testimony in federal court in boston the trial is being all but ignored by analysts and patent attorneys 
 most have read the pre-trial documents however and estimate kodak will be ordered to pay $ N billion to $ N billion for <unk> on seven polaroid patents 
 that may be the largest patent award ever but it is well below the $ N billion polaroid seeks 
 the highest patent damage award to date was in N when smith international inc. was ordered to pay $ N million to baker hughes inc. for <unk> on a patent on an oil drilling bit seal 
 the two companies later agreed to settle for $ N million 
 few analysts think it is worth their time to <unk> through the polaroid trial testimony 
 it 's like <unk> for gold outside of grand central station 
 you might find something but the chances are low said michael <unk> an analyst at wertheim schroder & co 
 and eugene glazer an analyst at dean witter reynolds inc. said if you hired an attorney to be there all the time and give you a prediction of the eventual award i would be willing to bet that he would be off by a lot 
 a <unk> trial in the early 1980s determined that kodak based in rochester n.y. infringed on patents of polaroid of cambridge mass 
 the main issues remaining are how to calculate damages and whether the infringement was willful and <unk> 
 if so the damages could be tripled 
 two analysts who have read the <unk> david nelson of shearson lehman hutton inc. and <unk> d. <unk> a litigation analyst at <unk> simpson & co. think judge a. david <unk> will decide in kodak 's favor on the willful and <unk> issue 
 mr. <unk> said testimony by kodak 's patent counsel francis t. carr of <unk> & <unk> showed that he worked with kodak <unk> from the outset of the project in an effort to avoid infringement 
 carr told kodak on many occasions to avoid various features because of polaroid 's patent positions and kodak followed his advice in every instance mr. <unk> said 
 but irving <unk> a patent expert at george mason university school of law who is familiar with the case said the fact that seven patents were infringed suggests that infringement was willful 
 it 's difficult to be that consistently wrong 
 observers also wonder whether judge <unk> will use the <unk> method of determining damages which polaroid favors because it would result in a larger award or the reasonable royalty method 
 polaroid claims it could have manufactured and sold all the instant cameras and film sold by kodak if kodak had n't entered the market 
 moreover polaroid contends it could have sold them at a higher price and thus made higher profits because it would n't have been forced to match kodak 's lower prices 
 each side has called a harvard business school professor to testify on that issue 
 kodak hired robert <unk> and polaroid brought in robert j. <unk> 
 there 's nothing that says that people at harvard business school have to agree with each other said mr. <unk> 
 testimony is expected to continue until early december 
 a decision is n't expected until some time next year 
 international business machines corp. said earnings tumbled N N in the third quarter even a bit further than expected <unk> the outlook doubtful for the next few quarters 
 the main reason was a delay in shipment of new high-end disk drives a business that accounts for some N N of ibm 's $ N billion of annual revenue 
 ibm which <unk> the poor results three weeks ago also cited an increase in its leasing business which tends to lock in business long-term but cut revenue in the near term 
 in addition ibm noted that the stronger dollar has cut the value of overseas revenue and earnings when they are translated into dollars 
 earnings fell to $ N million or $ N a share somewhat below securities analysts ' revised expectations of around $ N a share 
 that compared with the year-earlier $ N billion or $ N a share which was inflated by a <unk> gain from the sale of some mci communications corp. stock and by an unspecified amount from a payment by fujitsu ltd. relating to a software dispute 
 revenue climbed N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 ibm armonk n.y. remained upbeat 
 the computer giant whose u.s. results have been dismal for years noted that revenue rose again in the u.s. in the third quarter following an increase in the second period 
 the company said in a statement that demand for ibm products and services continues to be good world-wide 
 we do not see anything in the fundamentals of our business that would cause us to change our strategy of investing for profitable growth 
 securities analysts however remained <unk> 
 i think N will be another <unk> year said steve <unk> of first boston 
 jay stevens of dean witter actually cut his per-share earnings estimate to $ N from $ N for N and to $ N from $ N in N because he decided sales would be even weaker than he had expected 
 both estimates would mark declines from the N net of $ N billion or $ N a share which itself was well below the record ibm set in N 
 mr. stevens said he kept a <unk> recommendation on the stock only because all the damage has been done 
 he said the stock has n't traded below N N times book value over the past N years which at the moment <unk> to a stock price of $ N 
 the stock closed yesterday at $ N a share up just $ N in composite trading on the new york stock exchange as the market surged 
 analysts worry that the disk-drive and leasing problems will last at least through the first quarter 
 a key part of the question is how soon does this disk-drive come and how soon does production <unk> up said steve cohen at <unk> financial group 
 and the input i 've had from customers is that it still could be a while 
 on leasing bob <unk> at <unk> research said he thinks ibm has hurt itself <unk> 
 he said ibm has priced its leases aggressively thinking that would help win business 
 but he said ibm would have won the business anyway as a sale to a third party that would have then leased the equipment to the customer

 chicago options traders were among the big victims of friday 's plunging stock market including one small firm that required an emergency $ N million bailout 
 while monday 's rebounding markets helped other investors recoup losses many options customers and professional traders in stock-index options and the options on takeover stocks were left with multimillion-dollar losses traders here and in new york said 
 options traders were hurt worse than others on friday because of the highly volatile nature of options which often rise or fall in value several times the amount of the price change in the individual stock or index of stocks on which they are based 
 thus options traders friday were stuck with losses that also were several times larger than those suffered by many stock traders in new york 
 jeffrey miller of miller <unk> <unk> & co. said that given the high degree of leverage in the options market it is very easy for these guys to get wiped out 
 that may just be the nature of these highly leveraged little creatures 
 an options contract gives the holder the right to buy call or sell put a specific amount of stock or in this case the value of a stock index based on a <unk> price within a given time period 
 options traders who in return for a small fee or premium had previously sold put options on stocks or stock indexes were forced on friday to buy those contracts back at the previously agreed prices which were substantially above those in the market as it was falling 
 they then had no choice in many cases but to sell the contracts at prevailing prices in most cases at a substantial loss 
 the latest round of losses is likely to be a serious blow to the chicago board options exchange which has never fully recovered from the <unk> of black monday when investors fled the market because of huge losses 
 making matters worse was the fact that late friday afternoon the cboe halted stock-index options trading in step with the chicago mercantile exchange 's halt in stock-index futures 
 but while the merc reopened a half hour later the cboe remained closed leaving many options traders unable to make trades that might have reduced the losses 
 cboe chairman <unk> duke <unk> said that unlike the futures market the options exchange has to open in a <unk> that allows each different options series to trade 
 exchange officials <unk> that they would n't have been able to make such a <unk> with the time remaining friday afternoon and with the stock-index futures on the verge of closing for a second and final time the cboe <unk> that its best course was to remain closed 
 the damage was so bad at fossett corp. an options trading firm here that it was forced to transfer its accounts to first options of chicago a unit of continental bank corp. as a result of options trading losses 
 <unk> so far is the only member of a financial exchange to be forced to be taken over by another firm as a result of friday 's rout 
 fossett still had several million dollars in capital left after friday 's close of trading but not enough that regulators worried about another potential market plunge yesterday would let it reopen for trading options exchange officials said 
 thus in an unprecedented arrangement <unk> the <unk> of the transfer the cboe the american stock exchange and the options clearing corp. as well as the firm 's owner stephen fossett put up a total of $ N million to guarantee the customer positions being transferred to the bank holding company subsidiary in case the market plunged again yesterday

 first options did n't have to put any money into the bailout 
 yesterday 's rally in the stock futures and options markets led cboe and amex officials to conclude that the $ N million in guarantees almost certainly wo n't need to be tapped by first options 
 the fossett firm had some losses and liquidity problems during the october N crash as well mr. <unk> said 
 a federal official said that continental bank worked with securities and banking regulators over the weekend to fashion the fossett bailout but that conditions were n't <unk> by those agencies 
 it was their business decision the official said 
 officials at options clearing corp. which processes all options trades for u.s. exchanges said that the $ N million guarantee was unprecedented but was necessary to help insure the integrity of the options markets 
 it was an extraordinary situation that needed extraordinary steps said paul stevens <unk> president and chief operating officer 
 mr. stevens declined to give the specific contributions to the $ N million guarantee from each participant 
 but cboe and amex officials said that options clearing corp. contributed $ N million to the guarantee the cboe put up $ N million the amex added $ N million and $ N million came from mr. fossett 's own assets

 some <unk> have tried to get around this by calling themselves <unk> and describing their office visits as <unk> breaks

 in what is believed to be the first cancellation of a loan to china since the june N killings in beijing an international bank syndicate has terminated a $ N million credit for a shanghai property project 
 the syndicate led by <unk> asia ltd. agreed last november to provide the loan to asia development corp. a u.s. property developer 
 but several weeks ago in the wake of the beijing killings the loan was canceled according to bankers and executives close to the project 
 asia development and <unk> declined to comment on the move 
 lenders had doubts about the project even before june N but the harsh crackdown which caused many businesses to <unk> their china transactions gave the banks the out they wanted says an official close to the shanghai venture 
 the decision to cancel the loan <unk> the tough attitude bankers have taken toward china since june N 
 while some commercial lending has resumed international lenders remain nervous about china 's economic troubles and foreign debt $ N billion at the end of N 
 many loans are being <unk> especially those tied to the hotel sector which has been hit hard by a <unk> N tourism slump 
 many bankers view <unk> loans as particularly risky 
 the canceled shanghai loan leaves asia development a small concern <unk> with a <unk> <unk> apartment building and heavy debts 
 the company owes $ N million to the <unk> on group the project 's hong kong contractor and a significant though unspecified amount in legal fees to <unk> brothers a u.s. law firm the sources say 
 the project known as lotus mansion has been mired in controversy 
 when the loan agreement was announced it was hailed as one of the first western-style financing transactions ever used in china 
 unlike most loans to china there was no chinese <unk> 
 instead the banks secured a promise from state-owned bank of communications that it would lend asia development the entire $ N million at maturity to finance repayment of the original borrowing 
 the loan was to have <unk> in just two to three years as soon as construction was completed 
 but in a letter sent in august to asia development <unk> said the loan was terminated because the developer had failed to deliver adequate financial data and pay certain fees to the <unk> committee on time according to officials close to the project 
 creditors involved in the project contend however that the termination actually had nothing to do with these technical violations 
 instead the creditors say the loan fell victim to nervousness about china 's political turmoil as well as to concern about the loan 's security 
 the bank syndicate is made up mostly of european banks but it includes china 's state-owned <unk> industrial bank 
 the N banks in the syndicate sustained no monetary losses because none of the credit facility had been drawn down 
 k mart corp. agreed to acquire pace membership warehouse inc. for $ N a share or $ N million in a move to expand its presence in the rapidly growing <unk> business 
 the proposed merger comes as k mart 's profit is declining and sales at its core discount stores are rising more slowly than at such competitors as <unk> stores inc 
 k mart based in <unk> mich. recently said net income would fall for the third consecutive quarter after a N N drop in the first half of its current fiscal year 
 the membership <unk> concept has great potential the company 's chairman joseph e. <unk> said in a statement 
 warehouse clubs typically carry general merchandise and food products which they sell for close to wholesale prices in <unk> stores 
 shoppers many of whom operate small businesses pay annual membership fees which provide an income base for the stores 
 k mart tested the <unk> sector last year with its acquisition of a N N interest in <unk> inc 
 but the <unk> chain which operates as a joint venture between k mart and shv holdings n.v. of the netherlands has only six stores and annual sales that one analyst estimated at about $ N million 
 <unk> pace based in <unk> colo. operates N <unk> stores 
 the company had losses for several years before turning profitable in fiscal N 
 in the year ended jan. N pace <unk> up profit of $ N million or N cents a share after a tax-loss carry-forward on sales of $ N billion and analysts expect its results to continue to improve 
 the company turned the corner fairly recently in profitability said <unk> <unk> of painewebber inc. who had been forecasting a N N jump in pace 's net income from operations this year and another N N increase next year 
 warehouse productivity is really beginning to take off 
 but some analysts contend k mart has agreed to pay too much for pace 
 even if you look at it as a turnaround situation it 's expensive said wayne <unk> of prudential-bache securities inc 
 in my opinion you would only pay that kind of price if you were getting a premier player in the industry 
 ms. <unk> of painewebber raised a more fundamental question about the deal 
 if k mart ca n't get its act together in discounting why is it spending time worrying about other growing markets 
 she said i would say k mart 's number one job is to address its market-share loss in discount stores which longer-term will lead to improved profit margins 
 at that point perhaps diversification would be appropriate 
 but k mart 's mr. <unk> is intent on pushing the company into new retail businesses 
 for instance k mart is opening big food and general merchandise stores called <unk> and <unk> stores specializing in office products and sporting goods 
 it also operates <unk> pay less drug stores and builders square home improvement stores 
 in composite trading on the new york stock exchange k mart closed yesterday at $ N a share up N cents 
 pace rose $ N to close at $ N a share in national over-the-counter trading 
 a k mart spokesman said the acquisition would be financed with short-term borrowings 
 under terms of the agreement a k mart subsidiary will soon make a tender offer for pace shares 
 among the conditions of the offer is that pace shareholders tender a majority of the company 's shares outstanding 
 the companies said pace would ill continue to operate under its present management

 but it was the quotron problems that had <unk> effects 
 dillon read 's ms. stark said in early afternoon that she was still <unk> prices and other data as subject to <unk> and she said portfolio managers continued to question the numbers they saw on the screen 
 it was the second time in less than a week that quotron has had problems <unk> the industrial average 
 at the start of trading last wednesday the average appeared to plunge more than N points 
 actually it was down only a few points at the time 
 quotron said that <unk> which lasted nine minutes resulted from a failure to adjust for a <unk> stock split at philip morris <unk>

 but before the stock market rebounded from a sharp early sell-off yesterday he said you could n't buy junk bonds and you could n't give them away 
 yesterday 's rally was led by rjr holdings N N N bonds which initially tumbled three points or $ N for each $ N face amount to N N before rebounding to N N 
 bonds issued by <unk> <unk> <unk> and american standard also showed big gains recovering almost all their losses from friday and early yesterday 
 but traders said the junk bond market increasingly is <unk> into a <unk> group in which trades can be executed easily and a larger group of <unk> bonds in which liquidity or the ability to trade without too much difficulty has steadily deteriorated this year 
 liquidity has n't returned to the vast middle ground of the market said mr. <unk> of merrill 
 the <unk> are still <unk> said mr. <unk> of drexel 
 analysts are concerned that much of the high-yield market will remain <unk> for investors 
 paul <unk> associate professor at the massachusetts institute of technology 's sloan school of management citing a pattern of junk-bond default rates that are low in the early years after issuance and rise later says we 're now in a period where we 're starting to see defaults from the big issue years of N to N 
 mark <unk> a senior vice president at standard & poor 's corp. confirms that there is increasing concern about the future liquidity of the junk bond market 
 junk bonds are a highly <unk> market said lewis <unk> vice chairman of smith barney harris upham & co 
 there 's a whole bunch of stuff that 's money good and a whole bunch of stuff that 's not so good 
 analysts at standard & poor 's say junk bond offerings by tightly stretched issuers seem to be growing 
 almost $ N billion of junk bonds that are considered <unk> include issues from sci tv gillette holdings not related to gillette co. <unk> <unk> furniture allied stores federated department stores national <unk> <unk> holdings <unk> leaseway transportation and price communications 
 you could still have some very bad times ahead said mr. <unk> 
 it 's possible to have a N N default rate in one year because we 're already seeing big problems in the midst of a pretty strong economy 
 i 'm certainly not comfortable saying we 've seen the bottom 
 but yesterday 's rally among good junk was a badly needed <unk> for the market 
 many issues bounced off the floor mr. <unk> said and benchmark junk issues recovered all of their losses from friday and early yesterday 
 in contrast he says the stock market gained back only about half what it lost friday and the government bond market lost about half what it gained friday 
 traders said yesterday 's rally was fueled by insurance companies looking for bargains after a drastic slide in prices the past month 
 in addition mutual funds did n't appear to be major sellers of high-yield securities as was expected 
 sometimes a <unk> is healthy said drexel 's mr. <unk> 
 people will learn to be more <unk> 
 if they do good credit analysis they will avoid the hand <unk> 
 i think the market is in good shape 
 should you really own stocks 
 that 's a question a lot of people are asking following the stock market 's stunning display of volatility 
 <unk> financially and <unk> by friday 's <unk> 190-point drop in the dow jones industrial average and yesterday 's <unk> rebound they 're wondering if an individual has any business being in the market 
 the answer say academic researchers money managers and investment specialists is yes as long as you approach the stock market as an investor 
 but they say people should n't try to be traders who buy and sell in an effort to ride the latest economic trend or catch the next hot stock 
 the case for owning stocks over the long-term is compelling 
 if you look at N years worth of investment history including the great depression and every bear market since stocks have outperformed almost everything an individual could have owned by a long shot says barry berlin vice president at first wachovia capital management 
 a dollar invested in the stock market in N would have grown to $ N by the end of last june according to laurence <unk> managing director at <unk> associates inc 
 but a dollar invested in long-term bonds in N would have grown to only $ N and a dollar put in treasury bills would equal a <unk> $ N 
 the longer the time period the less risk there is of losing money in the stock market 
 over time the odds increasingly favor the investor with a diversified portfolio 
 for instance ken gregory a san francisco money manager <unk> that if an investor holds a basket of stocks that tracks the standard & poor 's 500-stock index the chance of losing money is N N to N N over a 10-year period compared with N N over three years and N N over one year 
 if you do n't need the money for N years there 's a <unk> case for sticking to a steady core of stocks mr. gregory says 
 stock-market investments also help balance the other assets an individual owns says john <unk> jr. president of the institute of certified financial planners 
 stocks have a place in an investors ' portfolio along with real estate bonds international securities and cash he says 
 there are some important <unk> before investing in stocks individuals should have at least three to six months of living expenses set aside in the bank most investment advisers say 
 individuals also should focus on building equity in a home which provides some protection against inflation as well as a <unk> that can be <unk> in late in life to help cover the cost of retirement living 
 people also should n't invest money in stocks that they 'll need in the near future for example for college tuition payments or retirement expenses 
 you may have to sell your stocks at a time when the market takes a plunge says mr. <unk> a del <unk> calif. financial planner 
 but once the <unk> are covered then i would start to invest even if it 's as little as $ N says michael lipper president of lipper analytical services inc 
 he says individuals should consider not just stocks but other long-term investments such as high-quality bonds 
 despite the strong case for stocks however most pros warn that individuals should n't try to profit from short-term developments 
 it 's very difficult to do says donald holt a market strategist for <unk> morgan securities a los angeles brokerage firm 
 our markets move so fast and they are so volatile there 's no way the average investor can compete with the pros 
 individual investors face high transaction costs of moving in and out of the market 
 the cost of executing stock orders <unk> from brokerage to brokerage and with the size of the order but N N of the order 's value is an average says stephen boesel manager of t. rowe price 's growth and income mutual fund 
 and assuming their first investment is successful investors will have to pay taxes on their gains 
 that can reduce returns by a third or more once local taxes are included mr. lipper says 
 after that individual traders face the risk that the new investment they choose wo n't perform well so their trading costs could be sustained for nothing 
 it 's very tough for most individuals to <unk> the mutual funds or the market says mr. lipper 
 you should really think twice if you think you can <unk> the system 
 then too many individual investors lack the <unk> emotional makeup professionals say is needed to plunge in and out of the market 
 so what 's the best way to buy stocks 
 unless an individual has a minimum of between $ N and $ N to invest in stocks he 's still better off in mutual funds than in individual stocks in terms of getting enough attention from a competent broker says mr. lipper 
 still he adds i could see owning both given that individuals often have an advantage over big investors in <unk> special situations based on their own <unk> he adds 
 george douglas first vice president at drexel burnham lambert inc. says that individuals have a particular edge now in small to <unk> niche companies with exciting earnings prospects a traditional <unk> ground for small investors 
 this growth sector which usually carries a <unk> multiple about twice that of the standard & poor 's N happens to include some of the market 's most attractive bargains right now 
 it 's now selling at a multiple about even with the market says mr. douglas 
 moreover mr. douglas sees a revival of institutional interest in smaller growth stocks that could boost the performance of these stocks in the medium term 
 many big wall street brokerage firms who eliminated their research effort in stocks of emerging growth companies a few years ago are now <unk> coverage of this area he notes 
 we 're seeing a real turnaround in interest in small growth stocks he says 
 the pros <unk> advise individuals to stay away from the latest investment fad 
 they say that 's especially important this late in the growth phase of the economic cycle when there 's no robust bull market to bail investors out of their mistakes 
 friday 's correction presents a pretty good buying opportunity but let 's not speculate at this point in the business cycle says <unk> <unk> chief equity portfolio strategist at first boston corp 
 buy stocks on weakness for their long-term fundamentals he says 
 in the long run investment advisers say most investors will be better off using the <unk> averaging method of buying stocks 
 in this method a person invests a regular amount every month or quarter into the stock market whether the market is up or down 
 that cuts the risk mr. gregory the san francisco money manager points out 
 when the market is low you are buying more shares and when it 's high you 're buying fewer shares he says 
 otherwise if you put all your money in at one time by sheer bad luck you might pick a terrible time and have to wait three years to get even mr. gregory says 
 a disciplined program will work the best mr. boesel says 
 one of the hardest things to do is to buy stocks when the market is down he says 
 but that 's just the time when you should be buying them

 donald trump who faced rising doubt about his bid for american airlines parent amr corp. even before a united airlines buy-out came apart friday withdrew his $ N billion offer 
 separately bankers representing the group trying to buy united 's parent ual corp. met with other banks about <unk> that purchase at a lower price possibly around $ N a share or $ N billion 
 but a lower bid could face rejection by the ual board 
 mr. trump who vowed wednesday to go forward with the bid said he was dropping it in light of the recent change in market conditions 
 he said he might now sell his amr stake buy more shares or make another offer at a lower price 
 the manhattan real-estate developer acted after the ual buyers failed to obtain financing for their earlier $ 300-a-share bid which sparked a selling panic among that <unk> into a 190-point drop friday in the dow jones industrial average 
 news about ual and amr whose shares never reopened after trading was halted friday for the ual announcement sent both stocks <unk> in composite trading on the new york stock exchange 
 ual tumbled $ N to $ N on volume of N million shares and amr declined by $ N to $ N as N million shares changed hands 
 together the two stocks <unk> havoc among takeover stock traders and caused a N N drop in the dow jones transportation average second in size only to the stock-market crash of oct. N N 
 some said friday 's market debacle had given mr. trump an excuse to bail out of an offer that showed signs of <unk> even before problems emerged with the ual deal 
 after reaching an intraday high of $ N the day mr. trump disclosed his bid oct. N amr 's stock had retreated as low as $ N last week 
 some takeover stock traders had been betting against mr. trump because he has a record of disclosing stakes in companies that are potential takeover targets then selling at a profit without making a bid 
 he still has n't proven his <unk> as a <unk> <unk> artist said airline analyst kevin murphy of morgan stanley & co 
 he 's done this thing where he 'll buy a little bit of a company and then trade out of it 
 he 's written this book the art of the deal 
 why does n't he just follow through on one of these things 
 mr. trump withdrew his bid before the amr board which is due to meet tomorrow ever formally considered it 
 amr had weighed a wide range of possible responses from flat rejection to <unk> and leveraged buy-outs that might have included either employees a <unk> buyer such as texas billionaire robert bass or both 
 amr had also sought to <unk> mr. trump in congress by lobbying for legislation that would have bolstered the authority of the transportation department to reject airline buy-outs 
 yesterday mr. trump tried to put the blame for the collapse of the ual deal on congress saying it was rushing through a bill to protect amr executives 
 i believe that the perception that legislation in this area may be hastily approved contributed to the collapse of the ual transaction and the resulting disruption in the financial markets experienced this past friday mr. trump wrote members of congress 
 amr declined to comment and mr. trump did n't respond to requests for interviews 
 mr. trump never said how much amr stock he had bought only that his holdings were substantial 
 however he only received federal clearance to buy more than $ N million of the stock on sept. N when the price rose $ N a share to $ N 
 between then and his bid on oct. N the price <unk> between $ N and $ N 
 in an attempt to persuade investors that his bid was n't just a stock play mr. trump promised last week to notify the market before selling any shares 
 amr was trading at around $ N yesterday before his withdrawal announcement then immediately fell to about $ N 
 assuming that he paid a rough average price of $ N a share and assuming he did n't sell before his announcement reached the market mr. trump could be sitting with a modest loss with the stock at $ N 
 some analysts said amr chairman robert crandall might seize the opportunity presented by the stock price drop to protect the nation 's largest airline with a defensive transaction such as the sale of stock to a friendly holder or company employees 
 however other knowledgeable observers said they believed mr. crandall and the amr board might well decide to tough it out without taking any extra steps 
 some analysts said they believed mr. trump whose <unk> <unk> had been viewed by some as a reason to believe he would n't back out might come back with a lower bid 
 ray <unk> of dillon read & co. said mr. trump is stepping back and waiting for the dust to settle 
 i 'm sure he still wants amr 
 but others remained skeptical 
 i was never sure donald trump really wanted to take amr said john <unk> a bond analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc 
 what happened with united was a <unk> way for him to <unk> out 
 mr. trump never obtained financing for his bid 
 that skepticism would leave him with an even greater credibility problem should he return that would <unk> him in any effort to oust the board in a proxy fight 
 meanwhile citicorp and chase manhattan corp. the two lead lenders on the ual buy-out met with other banks yesterday to determine if they would be willing to finance the buy-out at a lower price 
 officials familiar with the talks said citicorp had discussed lowering the offer to $ N a share but said that price was a talking point and that no decision has been made 
 at $ N a share the group would have to borrow about $ N billion from banks 
 the first ual deal unraveled after citibank and chase could n't raise $ N billion 
 citibank and chase had agreed to commit $ N billion and said they were highly confident of raising another $ N billion 
 together citicorp and chase received $ N million in fees to raise the rest of the financing 
 but other banks balked at the low interest rate and banking fees the ual group was willing to pay them 
 officials familiar with the bank talks said the ual buy-out group ual pilots management and british airways plc is now willing to pay higher bank fees and interest but is n't likely to boost its $ N million equity contribution 
 nor is the group likely to come forward with a revised offer within the next N hours despite the hopes of many traders 
 the group 's advisers want to make certain they have firm bank commitments the second time around 
 even if the buy-out group is able to obtain financing the transaction still faces obstacles 
 ual 's board could reject the new price as too low especially since there are n't any competing bids 
 los angeles investor marvin davis whose $ <unk> offer was rejected by ual 's board has n't shown signs of pursuing a $ 300-a-share <unk> bid he made last month 
 in addition the coalition of labor and management longtime enemies who joined forces only under the threat of mr. davis 's bid could break apart now 
 the group 's resilience gets its first test today when N top pilot union leaders <unk> outside chicago in a previously scheduled meeting 
 union chairman <unk> rick <unk> faces the tough task of explaining why banks refused to finance a buy-out the members approved <unk> last week 
 the pilot union is <unk> to pursue an acquisition whatever the board decides 
 but if the board <unk> a reduced bid and decides to explore other alternatives it could transform what has been a <unk> process into an <unk> one 
 the pilots could play <unk> by noting they are crucial to any sale or restructuring because they can refuse to fly the airplanes 
 if they were to insist on a low bid of say $ N a share the board might n't be able to obtain a higher offer from other bidders because banks might hesitate to finance a transaction the pilots oppose 
 also because ual chairman stephen wolf and other ual executives have joined the pilots ' bid the board might be forced to exclude him from its deliberations in order to be fair to other bidders 
 that could cost him the chance to influence the outcome and perhaps join the winning bidder 
 influential members of the house ways and means committee introduced legislation that would restrict how the new savings-and-loan bailout agency can raise capital creating another potential obstacle to the government 's sale of sick thrifts 
 the bill whose backers include chairman dan <unk> d. ill. would prevent the resolution trust corp. from raising temporary working capital by having an <unk> bank or thrift issue debt that would n't be counted on the federal budget 
 the bill intends to restrict the rtc to treasury borrowings only unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization 
 such agency <unk> borrowing is unauthorized and expensive far more expensive than direct treasury borrowing said rep. <unk> stark d. calif. the bill 's chief sponsor 
 the complex financing plan in the s&l bailout law includes raising $ N billion from debt issued by the newly created rtc 
 this financing system was created in the new law in order to keep the bailout spending from swelling the budget deficit 
 another $ N billion would be raised through treasury bonds which pay lower interest rates 
 but the rtc also requires working capital to maintain the bad assets of thrifts that are sold until the assets can be sold separately 
 that debt would be paid off as the assets are sold leaving the total spending for the bailout at $ N billion or $ N billion including interest over N years 
 it 's a problem that clearly has to be resolved said david <unk> executive director of the rtc 
 the agency has already spent roughly $ N billion selling N insolvent s&ls and it is likely to sell or merge N by the time the bailout concludes 
 <unk> other working capital he said the rtc would be forced to delay other thrift resolutions until cash could be raised by selling the bad assets 
 we would have to wait until we have collected on those assets before we can move forward he said 
 the complicated language in the huge new law has <unk> the fight 
 the law does allow the rtc to borrow from the treasury up to $ N billion at any time 
 moreover it says the rtc 's total obligations may not exceed $ N billion but that figure is derived after including notes and other debt and <unk> from it the market value of the assets the rtc holds 
 but congress did n't anticipate or intend more public debt say opponents of the rtc 's <unk> plan and rep. charles <unk> d. n.y said the rtc oversight board has been <unk> in not keeping congress informed 
 that <unk> leads to a proposal like the one from ways and means which seems to me sort of <unk> he said 
 the rtc is going to have to pay a price of prior <unk> on the hill if they want that kind of flexibility 
 the ways and means committee will hold a hearing on the bill next tuesday 
 we 're about to see if advertising works 
 hard on the heels of friday 's 190-point stock-market plunge and the uncertainty that 's followed a few big brokerage firms are rolling out new ads <unk> a familiar message keep on investing the market 's just fine 
 their mission is to keep clients from <unk> the market as individual investors did in <unk> after the crash in october 
 just days after the N crash major brokerage firms rushed out ads to calm investors 
 this time around they 're moving even faster 
 painewebber inc. <unk> a new television commercial at N p.m. edt yesterday and had it on the air by last night 
 fidelity investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday and wrote another new ad appearing today 
 shearson lehman hutton inc. by yesterday afternoon had already written new tv ads 
 it considered running them during tomorrow night 's world series broadcast but decided not to when the market recovered yesterday 
 other brokerage firms including merrill lynch & co. were <unk> out potential new ad strategies 
 the brokerage firms learned a lesson the last time around when frightened investors flooded the phone lines and fled the market in a panic 
 this time the firms were ready 
 fidelity for example prepared ads several months ago in case of a market plunge 
 when the market went into its free fall friday afternoon the investment firm ordered full pages in the monday editions of half a dozen newspapers 
 the ads touted fidelity 's automated <unk> beneath the huge headline fidelity is ready for your call 
 a fidelity spokesman says the <unk> which already was operating but which many clients did n't know about received about double the usual volume of calls over the weekend 
 a lot of investor confidence comes from the fact that they can speak to us he says 
 to maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial 
 it would have been too late to think about on friday 
 we had to think about it ahead of time 
 today 's fidelity ad goes a step further encouraging investors to stay in the market or even to plunge in with fidelity 
 <unk> the headline diversification it <unk> based on the events of the past week all investors need to know their portfolios are balanced to help protect them against the market 's volatility 
 it goes on to plug a few diversified fidelity funds by name 
 painewebber also was able to gear up quickly thanks to the N crash 
 in the aftermath of the N debacle the brokerage firm began taping commercials in-house ultimately getting its timing down fast enough to tape a commercial after the market closed and rush it on the air that night 
 it also negotiated an arrangement with cable news network under which <unk> would agree to air its last-minute <unk> 
 the new painewebber commercial created with ad agency saatchi & saatchi co. features mary farrell one of the firm 's most visible investment strategists <unk> particularly bullish 
 taped just as the market closed yesterday it offers ms. farrell advising we view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle 
 we continue to feel that the stock market is still the place to be for long-term appreciation 
 the spot was scheduled to appear three times on <unk> last night 
 painewebber considered an even harder sell recommending specific stocks 
 instead it settled on just urging the clients who are its <unk> to keep that money in the market 
 we 're saying the worst thing that anyone can do is to see the market go down and dump everything which just drives the prices down further says john <unk> painewebber 's director of advertising 
 if you owned it and liked it friday the true value has n't changed 
 he adds this is n't N <unk> 
 with the market <unk> and then closing up more than N points yesterday investment firms had to constantly revise their approach 
 at shearson lehman executives created potential new commercials friday night and throughout the weekend then had to <unk> yesterday afternoon 
 the plan had been to make one of shearson 's <unk> black-and-white where we stand commercials which have been running occasionally in response to news events since N 
 the ad would have run during the world series tomorrow replacing the debut commercial of shearson 's new ad campaign leadership by example 
 but in a meeting after the market closed yesterday shearson executives decided not to go ahead with the stock-market ad 
 we do n't think at this point anything needs to be said 
 the market seems to be <unk> out we 're taking a <unk> attitude says <unk> b. stewart executive vice president of marketing 
 in any case the brokerage firms are clearly moving faster to create new ads than they did in the fall of N 
 but it remains to be seen whether their ads will be any more effective 
 in N despite a <unk> of ads from most of the major investment firms individuals ran from the market en <unk> 
 now the firms must try their hardest to prove that advertising can work this time around 
 ad notes 
 arnold advertising 
 edward <unk> former chairman of della femina mcnamee <unk> reached an agreement in principle to acquire a majority stake in arnold advertising a small boston shop 
 terms were n't disclosed

 john <unk> the agency 's president and chief executive will retain the title of president

 education ads 
 a <unk> ad supplement to business week 's special corporate elite issue calls on business leaders to use their clout to help solve the nation 's education crisis

 the magazine will distribute N N of the gross revenues from the supplement as grants to innovative teachers 
 you know what the law of averages is do n't you

 baseball that game of the long haul is the <unk> sport of the mean and the mean <unk> law caught up with the san francisco giants in the world series last weekend 
 the team that dumped runs by the bushel on the chicago cubs in the national league playoffs was held to just one in two games by the <unk> oakland a 's the gang that had been done <unk> similarly by the los angeles <unk> and <unk> <unk> in last year 's <unk> 
 <unk> much of the damage was accomplished by a 's who had some catching up to do 
 in game two on a cool sunday evening in this land of perpetual autumn a lot of the catching up was done by the a 's <unk> terry <unk> 
 he hit a N pitch from rick <unk> into the <unk> stands in inning four to stretch his team 's lead from N to a decisive N where it stayed 
 so what if <unk> had struck just seven home runs in N regular-season games and <unk> in the seventh position of the a 's lineup 
 if you get your pitch and take a good swing anything can happen he later <unk> 
 on saturday night quite a few of the boys in green and gold <unk> away successes to <unk> the pain of past and no doubt future <unk> 
 mark <unk> the big <unk> oakland first <unk> had three hits in four at <unk> two more than he 'd had in the <unk> <unk> series in which he 'd gone <unk> 
 the <unk> <unk> <unk> N through N <unk> the bottom of the order got seven of their team 's N hits and scored four of its runs in a N decision 
 <unk> dave stewart held the giants to five hits to account for the zero on the other side of the saturday <unk> 
 that he was the a 's <unk> <unk> during its american league campaign with a N mark plus two wins over toronto in the playoffs indicates he may have some evening up coming but with the way his <unk> <unk> is <unk> that might not be this week 
 the same goes for mike moore another veteran who <unk> early struggles to permit the giants but a run and four hits in seven <unk> in sunday 's contest 
 every guy they put out there had a better <unk> than the guy before <unk> giant manager roger craig 
 he 's an <unk> who 's one of the leading <unk> of the fashionable delivery which looks like a <unk> until it <unk> beneath the <unk> bat 
 the <unk> of the <unk> is that the a 's go into san francisco 's candlestick park tonight up two games to none in the <unk> <unk> 
 the <unk> to <unk> with here says that about three of four clubs N of N that took N series leads went on to win it all 
 that 's not an average to <unk> giant <unk> 
 one might think that the home fans in this series of the subway called bart that 's a better name for a public <unk> than desire do n't you think would have been <unk> over the proceedings but they <unk> them in relative calm 
 <unk> of the two <unk> sat side by side in the <unk> seats of oakland <unk> and while they cheered their <unk> and <unk> the opposition <unk> advanced no further at least as far as i could see 
 a few folks even showed up wearing <unk> bearing the colors and <unk> of both teams 
 i 'm for the giants today but only because they lost yesterday 
 i love <unk> both 
 the only thing i 'm <unk> for is for the series to go seven games said david williams a sacramento <unk> at the <unk> before sunday 's go 
 the above represents a <unk> of either <unk> or <unk> 
 i choose to believe it 's the latter although it probably springs from the fact that just about everyone out here including the a 's and giants is originally from somewhere else 
 <unk> it to say that if this were a new york <unk> series or one between the chicago cubs and white <unk> <unk> it 's possible you 'd need <unk> police in every other seat to separate opposing fans and only the <unk> would <unk> their <unk> 
 anyway the a 's gave you a lot of heroes to root for 
 in the opening game besides <unk> and stewart there was walt weiss a <unk> <unk> <unk> who had lost a couple months of the season to <unk> surgery 
 he was <unk> <unk> <unk> in game two moved a <unk> along in the a 's <unk> second inning and <unk> for his team 's final tally 
 such is his reputation among the east bay <unk> that when he hit his first career home run last season the fan who caught it agreed to turn the ball over to him in return for an <unk> 
 not his <unk> <unk> <unk> 's 
 an a 's <unk> of the second game was <unk> henderson who <unk> the hot side of the <unk> equation 
 he <unk> toronto in the playoffs with six hits seven walks and eight stolen bases in N at <unk> and continued that by going <unk> at the plate sunday along with walking stealing a base and scoring a run 
 when you 're in the <unk> you see every ball <unk> he <unk> 
 the cold guys in the set were will clark kevin mitchell and <unk> williams the giants ' N <unk> 
 they combined for N hits six home runs and N runs <unk> in in the five games against the cubs 
 they went a collective <unk> here with zero <unk> and <unk> 
 it 's that last set of numbers as much as anything else that gives the giants hope in the series games to come 
 i believe in the law of averages declared san francisco <unk> coach dusty baker after game two 
 i 'd rather see a <unk> <unk> who 's hot come up for the other side than a good <unk> who 's cold 
 but the old <unk> <unk> <unk> offered no prediction about when good times would return to his side 
 when it goes you never know when you 'll get it back he said 
 that 's baseball 
 ncr corp. reported a N N drop in third-quarter net income citing intense competition that caused its gross profit margins to dip 
 net income for the quarter fell to $ N million from $ N million roughly what analysts had expected 
 but per-share profit dropped only N N to $ N a share from $ N a share as the company continued its stock buy-back plan 
 average shares outstanding dropped to N million from N million 
 revenue fell N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 the computer maker which sells more than half its goods outside the u.s. also said the negative effect of a stronger u.s. dollar will <unk> affect its fourth-quarter performance and make it difficult to better N results 
 ncr said revenue declined both in the u.s. and overseas reflecting a world-wide softening of the computer markets 
 the company however said orders in the u.s. showed good gains during the latest quarter 
 analysts estimate those gains at N N to N N a good part of it coming from large orders placed by a few of ncr 's major customers 
 in addition to a general slowing of the computer industry ncr which sells automated teller machines and computerized cash <unk> is also affected by the retail and financial sectors areas of the economy that have generally not been robust notes <unk> g. <unk> an analyst for salomon brothers inc 
 these factors combined with a strong dollar should <unk> affect the current quarter 's results ncr said 
 in the year-earlier fourth quarter ncr had profit of $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N billion 
 mr. <unk> said he lowered his full-year estimates for N to $ N a share from $ N a share 
 revenue projections were slashed to $ N billion from $ N billion

 in the wake of wall street 's plunge last friday the london market was considered especially vulnerable

 the house aviation subcommittee approved a bill that would give the transportation secretary authority to review and approve leveraged buy-outs of major u.s. airlines 
 the collapsed plan to acquire ual corp. parent of united airlines spurred quick action on the legislation introduced wednesday and approved by the subcommittee on a voice vote yesterday 
 the bill is expected to be taken up by the public works and transportation committee tomorrow and a floor vote by next week will be urged 
 the measure drew criticism from the bush administration and a <unk> shot from financier donald trump who yesterday withdrew his takeover bid for amr corp. the parent of american airlines 
 in a letter to subcommittee chairman james <unk> d. minn. mr. trump criticized the bill as an explicit effort to thwart his bid for amr and said it contributed to the collapse of the deal 
 <unk> <unk> deputy transportation secretary also sent a letter to express the administration 's opposition to the bill in its present form 
 rep. <unk> brushed off mr. trump 's allegations as an excuse for his own deal failing 
 he also said the fact that the other letter had n't come from transportation secretary samuel skinner indicated there is <unk> room in the administration 's position 
 mr. <unk> and other committee members repeatedly stressed that the legislation was n't a response to any particular market situation 
 but they cited the ual and amr examples as reasons to move quickly to enact this legislation 
 aides both in the house and senate said the withdrawal of the trump bid for amr is n't likely to <unk> efforts to push the legislation 
 it 's still on the fast track and we still want to do it said one senate aide 
 the bill is aimed at addressing the concern that an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures to pay off the debt incurred in a leveraged buy-out 
 currently the transportation secretary does n't have clearly established authority to block mergers but can take the drastic step of <unk> the operating certificate of any carrier the official considers <unk> 
 supporters of the legislation view the bill as an effort to add stability and <unk> to the <unk> process and to preserve the safety and fitness of the industry 
 in general the bill would give the transportation department a 30-day review period before N N or more of the voting stock of a major u.s. air carrier could be acquired 
 it also would require the acquiring party to notify the transportation secretary and to provide all information relevant to determining the intent of the acquisition 
 the bill would allow the secretary to reject a buy-out if sufficient information has n't been provided or if the buy-out is likely to weaken the carrier financially result in a substantial reduction in size of the airline through disposal of assets or give control to a foreign interest 
 if more information is needed the secretary would have authority to extend the review period N days 
 all the witnesses both congressmen and industry experts expressed support for the bill in order to prevent <unk> from <unk> in on airline profits at the expense of safe <unk> service 
 but several committee members <unk> some backing mr. trump 's claim that the threat of regulation caused the failure of the ual deal and the stock-market plunge 
 one of the major concerns expressed by the <unk> was that large airlines would be prohibited from <unk> themselves of smaller entities and producing independent <unk> companies 
 in a possible prelude to the <unk> of talks between boeing co. and striking machinists union members a federal mediator said representatives of the two sides will meet with him tomorrow

 we 're encouraged that talks are scheduled again but beyond that we have made no expression of expectations a boeing spokesman said 
 the machinists union has rejected a three-year contract offer that would have provided a N N wage increase over the life of the pact plus some bonuses

 west german economics minister helmut <unk> said in my view the stock market will stabilize relatively quickly 
 there may be one or other psychological or technical reactions but they are n't based on fundamentals 
 the economy of west germany and the ec european community is highly stable 
 paris which has been the center of speculation fever in recent weeks also was hard hit

 frankfurt 
 one of the sharpest declines came in the financial center of europe 's strongest economy 
 the dax index of N west german blue chips plunged N N a one-day record <unk> out the summer 's gains 
 the index closed at N down N points 
 by comparison two years ago on black monday the new index would have dropped N N according to a projection by the exchange 
 investors may have reacted so strongly to friday 's u.s. stock market loss because they had vivid memories of the frankfurt exchange 's losing N N of its value in the N crash and its wake 
 this time however many small investors may have been hurt by acting so swiftly 
 they all went in the wrong direction said andreas <unk> an investment adviser for the bank in <unk> 's frankfurt branch 
 he said he told clients to buy selected west german blue chips after they fell by about N N 
 after the opening was delayed N minutes because of the crush of sell orders frankfurt 's normal <unk> trading session was extended N minutes to handle the heavy volume 
 the beginning was chaotic said nigel <unk> a broker for commerzbank ag 
 it took <unk> of an hour before enough prices could be worked out to get a reading on the market 
 institutional investors and bankers many of whom spent the night before in their offices watching far eastern markets were cautiously optimistic after the mild N N decline in tokyo stock prices 
 everybody was still confident including most institutional investors 
 that is why everybody was a little surprised by the storm of sell orders from small private investors said <unk> <unk> a senior trader for <unk> <unk> 
 some big institutions including banks began picking up <unk> shares late yesterday but most investors wanted to see what would happen in new york before acting 
 but even if wall street continues to stabilize analysts here say the latest blow to investor confidence could inhibit a swift recovery for the frankfurt exchange which already was showing signs of weakness after the dax had slipped from a N high of N on sept. N 
 some of west germany 's <unk> chips took some of the biggest hits 
 a N N drop for <unk> ag and dresdner bank ag 's N N decline were especially <unk> for their respective boards whose plans for major rights issues in november could now be in jeopardy 
 dresdner bank last month said it hoped to raise N billion marks $ N million by issuing four million shares at N marks each

 the financial times-stock exchange N share index closed off N points at N its high for the day after having plunged N points at N p.m 
 it was big institutions such as <unk> union insurance group scottish amicable investment managers and standard life assurance co. that <unk> the rally 
 attracted by low prices and encouraged by new york 's performance they <unk> up equities across the board 
 volume was N million shares more than triple recent levels 
 paris 
 late buying gave the paris <unk> a <unk> after its free fall early in the day 
 the <unk> general index ended down N N at N a drop of N points from friday 
 there was a volatility in the market that i have never seen before said <unk> <unk> a partner in brokerage firm <unk> <unk> 
 when wall street turned around shortly after the opening there was panic buying in paris 
 brokers said that as the news spread that wall street was moving up traders who had called to place sell orders changed their line in <unk> ordering buys instead 
 trading was driven primarily by small investors and speculators with large institutions waiting on the sidelines until late in the day 
 when wall street turned however the big boys entered the market looking for bargains 
 j.p. morgan & co. swung to a loss in the third quarter while ncnb corp. reported net income more than doubled and security pacific corp. net rose N N 
 j.p. morgan & co 
 j.p. morgan as expected posted a $ N billion net loss for the quarter reflecting the new york bank 's decision last month to add $ N billion to reserves for losses on loans to less-developed countries 
 the reserve addition placed the parent of morgan guaranty trust co. among a few major u.s. banks that have covered nearly all their medium and long-term portfolios to less-developed countries with reserves 
 the latest quarter 's loss <unk> $ N a share 
 in the year-earlier quarter morgan earned $ N million or $ N a share 
 george m. <unk> analyst at prudential-bache securities inc. called the results mildly disappointing 
 excluding the $ N billion provision and allowing for the taxes morgan paid earnings were about N cents a share mr. <unk> said 
 in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday morgan climbed $ N a share to $ N 
 net interest income sank N N in the quarter to $ N million from $ N million 
 the interest rate on short-term funds which banks borrow to finance longer-term loans to customers was sharply higher morgan said 
 morgan received $ N million of interest payments on its medium and long-term brazilian loans had they been <unk> interest net interest income would have been $ N million higher in the quarter morgan said 
 such loans to argentina also remain classified as <unk> costing the bank $ N million of interest income in the third period 
 income from sources other than interest climbed N N to $ N million reflecting higher <unk> and other fees and gains on sales of investment securities 
 these increases were partly offset by lower <unk> income the bank said 
 non-interest expenses grew N N to $ N million 
 ncnb corp 
 ncnb corp. 's net income more than doubled in the period largely because of continued strong performance by the bank 's texas operations 
 the charlotte n.c. company said earnings rose to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier 
 the latest quarter included a gain of $ N million or N cents a share related to the purchase of the remaining N N of ncnb texas national bank from the federal deposit insurance corp 
 the strong performance however <unk> with an unexpectedly large increase in the size of ncnb 's problem loans particularly in the southeast 
 in the third quarter nonperforming assets jumped to $ N million or N N of net loans and leases from $ N million or N N in the second quarter 
 <unk> totaled $ N million or N N in the year-ago third quarter 
 included in the increase in the most recent quarter is a $ N million loan which ncnb said it expects to be fully repaid with no loss early in the fourth quarter 
 the deterioration in credit quality offset strong loan growth of N N in ncnb 's southeast operations as well as a N N growth in deposits resulting from an aggressive marketing campaign 
 the higher rates paid on deposits also helped squeeze ncnb 's net interest margin in the southeast to N N from N N a year earlier 
 in big board composite trading yesterday ncnb jumped $ N a share to $ N 
 results were released after the market closed 
 ncnb texas national formed from the <unk> of of the failed first <unk> corp. of dallas contributed $ N million to ncnb 's bottom line in the third quarter 
 ncnb said its third-quarter results reflect N N of earnings of the texas operation since aug. N 
 ncnb raised some $ N billion in new capital during the quarter to complete the ncnb texas purchase and to acquire several small failed thrifts to fill out its regional franchise 
 last week the banking company said it purchased both freedom savings & loan association tampa fla. and university federal savings association of san antonio texas for $ N million 
 in the first nine months ncnb 's net income climbed N N to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier 
 security pacific corp 
 security pacific 's earnings growth slowed in the third quarter but the los angeles bank holding company was still able to post a N N increase in net income because of robust growth in residential real-estate and consumer loans 
 net rose to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier 
 the company said the gain resulted mainly from a $ N million increase in net interest income reflecting a N N increase in real estate loans mainly residential and a N N rise in consumer loans 
 these <unk> loans in effect replaced some <unk> assets such as <unk> loans which were allowed to decrease 
 as a result security pacific 's net interest margin fell only N basis points a more mild decrease than some major banks outside california which have been reporting more sluggish earnings 
 security pacific shares closed at $ N down N cents in big board composite trading 
 the earnings represent a N N return on assets for security pacific and an N N return on equity 
 the loan growth offset continuing real-estate loan losses in the depressed arizona market 
 security pacific reported a N N increase in net credit losses for the quarter to $ N million from $ N million in the year-ago period 
 nonperforming loans grew slightly to $ N billion at sept. N from $ N billion a year ago 
 security pacific 's loan-loss provision was down N N or $ N million because it added to its <unk> reserve the year before 
 non-interest income fell N N in the quarter mainly because of an unusual gain a year earlier from the sale of hong kong banking operations 
 non-interest expense grew only N N in the period 
 for the nine months net rose N N to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier 
 lin broadcasting corp. said it wo n't take a position on a revised tender offer by mccaw cellular communications inc. to buy lin and has asked for <unk> of the offer 
 the new offer which seeks N N of the cellular and broadcasting concern is for $ N a share for N million lin shares 
 mccaw 's revised tender offer would require mccaw to begin an auction process in july N that would buy out remaining holders at a per-share price roughly equivalent to what a third party might then have to pay for all of lin 
 lin is asking mccaw to clarify its tender offer which challenges an agreement between bellsouth corp. and lin to merge their <unk> businesses 
 bellsouth has notified lin that it would shortly respond to the mccaw proposal in as full and effective a manner as is <unk> 
 the lin board said holders may be <unk> by the provision in the mccaw proposal that guarantees private market value after five years for the remaining shares 
 mccaw has no obligation to purchase and the definition of private market value is uncertain the lin board said 
 the board added that mccaw would be able to control lin 's operations and could therefore operate lin in a manner which could <unk> its private market value and <unk> to a <unk> <unk> in five years 
 in national over-the-counter trading lin closed at $ N down $ N

 u.s. trade representative carla hills said the first <unk> panel set up under the <unk> free trade agreement has ruled that canada 's restrictions on exports of pacific <unk> and <unk> violate the accord 
 mrs. hills said the u.s. and canada have until nov. N to resolve the dispute 
 if a solution is n't reached by then she said the u.s. would have the right to suspend some trade concessions to canada equivalent in value to the losses suffered by u.s. <unk> companies in alaska and the pacific northwest

 the u.s. trade representative declined to put a dollar estimate on the losses resulting from the canadian export restrictions 
 canada initially had an export prohibition that was replaced by regulations requiring that such fish had to be brought <unk> in british columbia by commercial <unk> prior to export 
 this action was defended by the canadian government on conservation grounds 
 mrs. hills said yesterday that the <unk> panel rejected this canadian government argument 
 we fully expect that canada will comply with the panel 's ruling that the landing requirement also must be ended she said 
 earlier an international panel set up under the rules of the general agreement on tariffs and trade in geneva determined that the original canadian <unk> restrictions violated gatt rules 
 mrs. hills said the u.s. wo n't accept any delays after nov. N because u.s. <unk> firms enter into contracts in the fall to purchase the next season 's catch

 if all the bondholders and holders of one million common shares accept the offer bsn will increase its debt by $ N million but it also will recognize a $ N million gain from retiring the old debt said michael j. blumenfeld president

 the offers are scheduled to expire in <unk> to late november 
 merrill lynch & co. 's net income dropped N N while bear stearns cos. posted a N N gain in net and painewebber group inc. 's profit fell but would have risen without a special gain a year ago 
 at merrill lynch <unk> net was $ N million or N cents a share down from $ N million or N cents a share a year ago 
 total revenue reached $ N billion up N N from $ N billion 
 the firm 's drop in net reflected weaker revenue in transactions for its own account a decline of N N to $ N million on reduced revenue from trading fixed-income securities 
 investment banking revenue fell N N to $ N million on fewer equity and municipal <unk> 
 merrill lynch 's commission revenue grew N N however to $ N million on higher share prices and volume and on strong sales of mutual funds

 the brokerage also reported a loss of $ N million from the discontinued operations and disposal of its fine homes international limited partnership real-estate subsidiary

 the market upheaval apparently has n't triggered any cash crunch yet 
 individual investors investment firms and arbitragers who speculate in the stocks of takeover candidates can suffer liquidity and payment problems when stocks dive those investors often borrow heavily to buy their holdings and use the stocks as collateral for loans 
 but several large banks said yesterday they detected no signs of unusual demand for credit that would signal such difficulties 
 we 're seeing nothing out of the ordinary said one official at a top N bank 
 that 's good news because we all <unk> in this water

 now as for tomorrow hell who knows 
 what happened friday shows that financial markets are not yet sufficiently <unk> to handle another <unk> in prices 
 no <unk> with systems and procedures will ever prevent markets from suffering a panic wave of selling 
 but markets can operate with greater or lesser efficiency 
 after the N plunge markets agreed that it would be <unk> to halt trading whenever panic conditions arose 
 the new york stock exchange adopted two specific circuit breakers if the dow jones index falls N points in a day the exchange will halt trading for one hour if the decline hits N points the exchange will close for an additional two hours 
 the rationale is that an <unk> of trading will allow investors to reconsider their strategies calm sellers and lead buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels 
 it is impossible to know whether that theory is realistic 
 a temporary <unk> of trading may indeed discourage a selling panic from feeding on itself 
 but there is also the possibility that <unk> down markets will intensify fears and cause an even more abrupt slide in prices 
 what happened friday was the worst of all <unk> 
 the futures exchanges followed their own <unk> circuit breakers and shut down at about N p.m. for N minutes after the standard & poor 's N stock index had fallen N points or about N points on the dow jones index 
 options markets stopped trading in many securities 
 the new york stock exchange under its own rules remained open 
 with nowhere else to go sellers and particularly program traders focused all their selling on the new york stock exchange 
 as liquidity on that market weakened prices fell sharply 
 had the futures and options markets been open additional liquidity would have been provided and the decline most probably would have been less intense 
 at N after intense telephone negotiations between the trading markets and washington the futures exchanges reopened 
 futures trading however was halted altogether at N after the futures markets had dropped an additional N points which is the daily limit for price declines 
 at this point the options markets also shut down and once more left all sales to be handled by the new york stock exchange 
 it is time to recognize that the new york stock exchange the futures markets and the options markets though <unk> separate have actually become so closely <unk> as to constitute one market effectively 
 traders can vary their strategies and execute their orders in any one of them 
 it therefore makes no sense for each market to adopt different circuit breakers 
 to achieve maximum liquidity and minimize price volatility either all markets should be open to trading or none 
 <unk> circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on friday but they probably would have made for <unk> less volatile executions 
 it 's time for the exchanges and the securities and exchange commission to agree on joint conditions for <unk> trading or staying open 
 let 's not have one market shut down for N minutes when the dow declines N points and another shut down for an hour after a <unk> decline 
 the need for <unk> last-minute telephone negotiations among market officials will disappear once rules are in place that <unk> circuit breakers in all markets 
 the new circuit breakers if they are to be applied at all will require that futures and options trading continue as long as the new york stock exchange remains open 
 the rules should be established by agreement of the officials of all affected exchanges acting under the oversight and with the approval of the government regulatory agencies 
 should the sec and the commodities futures trading commission which with the sec <unk> the chicago stock-index markets be unable to agree the issue may have to be resolved by decision of the treasury secretary 
 in many ways our financial markets are better prepared today to handle a decline than they were two years ago 
 the new york stock exchange now has the capacity to handle a volume of nearly a billion shares a day 
 telephone service has been improved for customers trying to reach their brokers and specialists who i believe should stay despite the <unk> of some post-crash critics have larger capital positions 
 of course specialists ' actions alone can never prevent a major crack in stock prices 
 witness the fact that trading in some stocks closed early friday and opened late monday because of an excess of sell orders 
 but the task of improving market performance remains <unk>

 the continuing series of hud scandals is a <unk> predictable result of pork-barrel politics 
 nevertheless <unk> such as the national association of home builders nahb continue to pressure capitol hill for more special-interest spending 
 kent <unk> nahb executive vice president argues that the u.s. faces a <unk> housing crisis reduced <unk> of homes for first-time buyers increased homelessness and lower apartment construction rates that will be very difficult to solve without expanded federal resources 
 there 's nothing unusual about business groups pushing for more government spending 
 but the nahb was created in N out of an organization that made its name fighting a <unk> administration proposal to take over all defense housing production 
 through the years the association has been an active member of the taxpayer 's coalition pushing for such initiatives as the <unk> amendment 
 yet on matters close to <unk> home 
 the hud budget has dropped by more than N N since N argues mr. <unk> 
 we 've taken more than our fair share 
 i would n't have a problem if other programs had taken a similar hit 
 but nahb support for subsidies is not related to the current housing crunch over the years the nahb has backed a host of public programs 
 it once pushed for a national housing production goal set by the federal government and has regularly advanced <unk> housing measures 
 moreover explains one hud official the nahb remains susceptible to internal pressure from members that specialize in subsidized production 
 the association is pushing an extensive and expensive <unk> which would substantially boost spending above the current level of more than $ N billion annually 
 direct federal subsidies for housing construction have proved <unk> expensive in the past and inevitably are <unk> to the benefit of <unk> developers and lobbyists as demonstrated by the ongoing hud scandal or congressmen 
 indirect subsidies through the fha for instance are little better 
 though mr. <unk> says expanding fha lending would result in no cost to the government the mere diversion of funds from other parts of the economy and from other forms of housing such as low-income to the single-family home market would result in a major expense 
 more important housing programs run by hud the va and <unk> are <unk> in red ink 
 the fha alone lost $ N billion in fiscal N the government 's equity in the agency essentially its reserve fund fell to minus $ N billion 
 the federal government has had to pump in $ N billion into the va housing program since N to keep the fund afloat and the va requested an additional $ N million for the fiscal year just ended 
 all told the federal government already guarantees more than $ N billion of mortgages 
 in its <unk> produced publication where will our children live the nahb does acknowledge that of course the full measure of housing <unk> can not be provided by the federal government 
 it points to the <unk> impact of local government regulation particularly <unk> and building fees which <unk> the price of housing out of the reach of <unk> and <unk> people 
 but while the nahb has suggested actions that states and <unk> should take to reduce regulatory barriers the association has proposed no activist legislative program comparable to say its detailed request for more federal subsidies to eliminate <unk> controls 
 the association a majority of whose N members build fewer than N units a year is like many other business <unk> 
 explains <unk> macdonald of the national taxpayers union it <unk> in two <unk> 
 the builders like the subsidies but at the same time they tend to be fiscal conservatives in terms of major issues such as the <unk> amendment 
 unfortunately the organization 's desire for pork tends to override its commitment to overall fiscal responsibility 
 two years ago when the nahb lobbied for the $ N billion omnibus housing bill the organization basically dropped out of the taxpayers ' coalition says ms. macdonald 
 as mr. <unk> of the nahb acknowledges government is not going to solve the problem 
 the real key is to have the economy working and interest rates down 
 more money for hud will increase the deficit and <unk> the economy more money to municipalities that are <unk> their local housing markets will further <unk> them from the <unk> effects of their policies 
 is this what the home builders want

 in an attempt to give new momentum to european community plans for a single currency ec government leaders are likely to agree to set a date for starting formal talks on <unk> the ec 's founding treaty of rome

 the only strong opposition to changing the ec treaty comes from british prime minister margaret thatcher who is opposed to creating a single ec currency 
 but the process of <unk> the <unk> conference does n't require <unk> 
 setting a date to start treaty negotiations has no legal significance in itself but could be viewed as an important psychological push 
 french president <unk> mitterrand fought to set a date for the conference during the ec summit in madrid last june but the move was <unk> because of opposition by mrs. thatcher and west german chancellor helmut kohl

 the latest <unk> in the equities markets <unk> me of the joke t. boone pickens tells about the guy who was run over by the parade 
 when asked what went wrong the unfortunate victim replied it was a combination of things 
 and so it was on gray friday 
 the grand <unk> of this parade would appear to have been excess leverage 
 even if that is so however it 's probably the case that no barriers should have been <unk> to stop the <unk> before the end of the rout e 
 the <unk> began friday afternoon when word spread that the ual buy-out was <unk> 
 although the <unk> expects to patch together a substitute offer consisting of less cash the failure to get cash from japanese and american banks confirmed a growing fear among arbitragers that the <unk> of <unk> takeover deals is ending 
 lots of other <unk> made up the parade of course notably a surprisingly large increase in producer prices <unk> federal reserve <unk> and the bush administration 's temporary defeat in trying to lower the capital-gains tax 
 as usual few favorable reviews were heard for that <unk> <unk> band of program traders although most serious studies suggest they only play the music that others write 
 what really spooked the <unk> along wall street however was the sudden concern that whatever the reason the pool of debt capital is <unk> up 
 gray friday reflects a panic mainly by the takeover arbitragers rather than the small investor as their highly <unk> investments in the deal stocks are <unk> by the unexpected <unk> up of the <unk> for deal financing 
 deal stocks led the market down as they absorbed the heaviest losses 
 ual which triggered the slide opened monday at $ N down about N N from thursday 's close 
 amr opened monday at $ N down nearly N N from thursday 's close 
 both took further hits yesterday 
 hilton lost N N on friday paramount lost almost N N 
 a careful look reveals that where deal financing has been secured the target 's stock price was not affected on friday 
 the multibillion-dollar prospects where the bidder must line up a consortium of banks <unk> issue billions in high-yield debt were where the damage was concentrated 
 the market for so-called junk bonds has been setting the stage for friday 's dramatic march for several weeks 
 the growing financial difficulties of recent <unk> restructurings or takeovers such as resorts international integrated resources and campeau 's retailing empire have cast a pall over the entire market for high-yield securities 
 investors have reacted by ignoring recent efforts to float junk bonds by ohio <unk> and by forcing ramada to postpone indefinitely its planned junk-bond sale and restructuring 
 as a result high-yield mutual funds have declined across the board and the many firms planning to sell $ N billion in junk bonds before year-end are experiencing anxious times 
 these are all market excesses putting aside the <unk> boosts that the tax code gives to debt over equity and what we 've seen is the market <unk> them in 
 of course washington had n't been silent in the days leading up to the debacle and its tendency to <unk> in the leverage equation remains a troublesome prospect but those preliminary steps should n't <unk> us from the basic market <unk> that was at work on friday 
 if it is correct to find that concerns over corporate debt and lbos caused gray friday what are the implications for policy makers 
 after all the stock market 's response to the collapse of the ual deal might be taken to confirm the <unk> direction of regulators 
 is this a case where private markets are <unk> of washington 's <unk> of wall street 
 absolutely not 
 to the extent that friday 's sell-off reflected a sudden <unk> of the excesses of leverage the message is that wall street and the private markets are fully capable of imposing the appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior 
 the national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various lbo deals and leveraged restructurings 
 the recent difficulties in the junk-bond markets and the <unk> of bank capital for recent deals <unk> the wisdom of letting the free markets operate 
 if takeover premiums become excessive if lbo <unk> become too aggressive then the private market will recognize these problems more quickly and accurately than will policy makers and the markets will move with <unk> speed to impose appropriate sanctions 
 yes the broader exchanges got caught up in the <unk> but they rode the tiger up all year 
 not surprisingly he sometimes <unk> 
 the arbitragers and takeover <unk> got killed on gray friday while the besieged managers of prospective targets cheered <unk> 
 if you identify with the besieged managers you must concede that <unk> and effective relief from the excesses of the takeover market is more likely to come from the marketplace than from washington 
 if you side with the arbitragers and raiders you clearly have more to fear from private investors than from regulators although the delaware courts should never be underestimated 
 the truth is washington understands politics better than economics 
 although the average citizen is probably not <unk> too much from washington 's <unk> war against wall street regarding excessive financial <unk> actual legislation would probably impose considerable harm 
 any such attempt to <unk> good debt from bad debt or to draw the line at a particular industry such as the airlines is likely to blunt the spur that the proper amount of leverage provides both to equity markets and economic efficiency in general 
 far better for policy makers to concentrate on the war against drugs panama and the deficit all of them <unk> that seem never to end

 other asian and pacific markets had sharper losses than tokyo but the selling wave stopped short of <unk> another market crash 
 all eyes were on tokyo at the opening because it was the first major market to trade since friday 's 190.58-point plunge on wall street

 we did n't trade much today as our policy now is to wait and see said a fund manager at <unk> life insurance co 
 we would like to wait and see until trading goes around through europe and new york 
 the institutions appeared confident that japanese regulators would step in to ensure orderly trading if necessary and there was considerable speculation during the day that the finance ministry was working behind the scenes to do just that

 the market opened sharply lower with the nikkei average down nearly N after N minutes 
 a midmorning rebound brought it back to show a gain of about N at the end of the morning session but the rally failed in the afternoon and the market closed near the day 's low 
 the smaller stocks in the tokyo market 's second section also posted their biggest decline of the year 
 the tokyo stock exchange index for the second section fell N or N N to N 
 many investors trying to outperform the market 's major indexes have <unk> to these small issues in recent weeks 
 japanese investors and traders expressed relief that the tokyo market did n't fall more sharply

 this time wall street 's plunge of N N friday was followed by yesterday 's N N loss in tokyo

 thus market participants yesterday were looking ahead nervously to wall street 's opening

 the initiative seems to have been <unk> to include all the hot issues that set off the wealthy hollywood <unk> who <unk> money 
 and it allows mr. van de <unk> to get around campaign spending limits 
 he can spend the legal maximum for his campaign all the spending for the van de <unk> initiative on which there are no limits is <unk> 
 this initiative is being labeled the big green but maybe it should be called the big <unk> 
 the republican candidate sen. pete wilson is playing the initiative <unk> game too <unk> his own crime initiative 
 while it is possible that the big green initiative will be ruled unconstitutional it is of course <unk> that in modern california it could slide through 
 this is the state that recently passed the <unk> N <unk> initiative 
 if this new proposal ever does become law the green lobby will benefit directly 
 the initiative creates a free floating state environmental officer to sue companies or government agencies that do things he does n't like 
 that means the <unk> and such groups no longer would have to spend as much money on litigation taxpayers would bear the cost 
 mr. van de <unk> and his allies may be hoping that the environment is such a mom and <unk> issue among certain segments of california 's population now that almost any collection of <unk> <unk> nonsense can pass under its <unk> 
 of course the state 's liberals are not yet a nation <unk> themselves 
 george bush for example may decide that he does n't want to be the president who lost control of interstate commerce to an attorney general from california 
 and some other segments of california 's political and media culture may yet start to point out that the initiative would impose significant costs on the state 's less affluent citizens in the form of higher food prices and lost jobs 
 this <unk> initiative will help california define itself for the future either as a state still <unk> to economic and scientific reality or as one being led to wherever its <unk> activists want to take it

 spurred by waves of large-scale buying in blue-chip stocks the dow jones industrial average rallied yesterday and erased about a half of friday 's 190.58-point plunge gaining N to N 
 it was the <unk> advance for the average of N blue chips on <unk> new york stock exchange volume of N shares the highest since the days after the N crash 
 while the advance cheered investors who feared a <unk> crash would occur yesterday it was strictly a <unk> rally fed by huge buying by bargain-hunting institutions and program traders 
 a troubling sign declining stocks on the big board outnumbered advancers N to N and the over-the-counter market that includes many smaller stocks suffered aftershocks of friday 's late big board plunge 
 the nasdaq otc index closed down N to N 
 meanwhile in a divergence in two of the market 's most important indicators the dow industrials ' sister average the <unk> dow jones transportation average tumbled N to N its <unk> decline next to the <unk> fall during the N crash 
 <unk> plunged on takeover disappointments in two airline stocks ual and amr which each fell more than N N when they reopened for trading yesterday after being suspended friday afternoon 
 ual the takeover stock at the center of friday 's 190.58-point market plunge fell N N to N N on nearly N million shares 
 overall this is a <unk> rally but it 's very selective said arthur <unk> jr. a veteran painewebber inc. trader at the big board 
 everyone was a little concerned about the general <unk> of the rally and failure of the otc market to get into plus territory 
 it 's just a strange feeling 
 i do n't think anyone left the place <unk> <unk> 
 the rally gave <unk> at least for now to the <unk> declaration of big board chairman john j. phelan jr. that friday 's market debacle was an <unk> condition and not a disaster 
 but to traders it looked like disaster on the N a.m. opening bell 
 the dow jones industrial average opened down N shortly after N 
 but most of the N blue-chip stocks in the average including eastman kodak and general motors could n't trade because of the heavy backlog of sell orders left over from friday 's <unk> rout 
 at N procter & gamble one of the most important dow <unk> of late opened down N N to N 
 the dow dropped to a quick <unk> loss and to many traders it looked as if stocks were headed for yet another big tumble 
 more stocks opened over the <unk> half hour as the N big board specialist firms in charge of keeping the market orderly <unk> to find buy orders from major brokerage firms to match the selling flood 
 then to make matters worse computerized sell programs kicked in <unk> stocks into <unk> losses 
 there was heavy stock-index arbitrage as traders sold big baskets of stock and bought stock-index futures to profit from the price discrepancies between the two markets 
 this was a <unk> from friday when standard & poor 's 500-stock index futures had closed at a sharp discount to stocks 
 the <unk> of the program selling dashed any hopes that some of the big program trading firms would hold off until the market stabilized 
 they did n't 
 the dow accelerated its slide losing N in the first N minutes of trading 
 with program traders seemingly in charge buyers backed away from the market and watched stocks fall 
 then at N the dow suddenly started to rebound and when it shot upward it did so even faster than the <unk> fall 
 and this time it was n't just the program traders who were responsible 
 all the selling had pushed stocks to such cheap values that big investment banks and major money management firms started buying stocks heavily 
 the program traders were in there too of course 
 but according to one trader the programmers did n't look as dominant on the upside as on the downside because there was also a lot of bargain-hunting by institutions 
 <unk> m. <unk> director of the new jersey division of investment which oversees $ N billion in investments said the first thing we did was to double our orders yesterday morning

 but in another dramatic burst the dow tacked on N points in five minutes and at N the index showed a gain of N

 it was <unk> on the upside said one big board specialist 
 but not everybody was making money 
 the <unk> on the chicago board options exchange the nation 's major options market was heavy after the trading in s&p N stock-index options was halted friday 
 many market makers in the s&p N index options contract had bullish positions friday and when the shutdown came they were frozen with huge losses 
 over the weekend clearing firms told the chicago market makers to get out of their positions at any cost monday morning 
 they were absolutely killed <unk> said one chicago-based options trader 
 some traders said that the closely watched major market index whose N stocks mimic the dow industrials did n't lead yesterday 's big rally 
 james <unk> a partner at specialist <unk> & <unk> said the difference between today and two years ago terrible tuesday oct. N N is that then we needed a <unk> to go into the major market index spend $ N million and get the program rally started 
 this time institutions saw the programs coming and backed away and backed away 
 then when the market was at a technical level to buy they came in with a <unk> 
 however according to one analyst the timing of major market index futures buying just before the turnaround was similar to that of terrible tuesday 
 futures were pulling the stock market higher said donald <unk> head of stock-index futures research at prudential-bache securities inc 
 although the big board 's specialist firms struggled through another highly volatile trading session their performance yesterday was better than during friday 's <unk> chaos according to traders and brokers who work with them 
 specialists were criticized for their inability to maintain orderly markets during the friday plunge 
 but yesterday even with halts in such major blue-chip stocks as merck we expected the halts and it was n't too bad said donaldson 's mr. <unk> who had been critical of the specialists ' performance on friday 
 according to a big board official while many stocks opened late there were subsequent trading halts in only three issues amr merck and <unk> energy 
 merck is one of the most important stocks in the major market index 
 no sector of the market has been <unk> during the past two days ' gyrations 
 yet from the dow industrials ' high on oct. N through friday 's plunge relatively good performances have been turned in by real-estate utilities precious metals and life insurance stocks 
 and yesterday the top performing industry group was oil field equipment issues 
 for example <unk> jumped N N to N <unk> rose N N to N N and baker hughes rose N N to N 
 because of the ual and amr <unk> airlines were the weakest sector of the market yesterday

 mr. phelan said that program trading strategies were n't responsible for triggering friday 's decline despite a jump in the use of the computer-driven strategies in recent months 
 some N million of the more than N million shares traded in the final N minutes of friday 's session when the plunge in stock prices was concentrated were <unk> he said 
 program trades make up N N of the exchange 's volume on an average day but despite the increase friday it was certainly not something you would say <unk> the market decline mr. phelan said 
 mr. phelan expressed relief that the market rebounded yesterday 
 obviously every time we get this kind of reaction it 's going to make everybody nervous including me he said 
 he said that exchange officials had conversations with wall street firms throughout the weekend and that all the participants behaved very very <unk> today 
 meanwhile peter dapuzzo shearson 's head of retail equity trading praised institutional investors in the otc market who were heavy buyers of the nasdaq 's biggest technology issues yesterday amid a flood of selling by other investors 
 the institutions ca n't be criticized for their behavior mr. dapuzzo said in an interview 
 it was the opposite of what happened on oct. N 
 they used their judgment 
 they did n't panic during the first round of selling this morning 
 instead they bought on weakness and sold into the strength which kept the market orderly 
 maybe they learned from experience 
 mr. phelan said the performance of specialists during friday 's plunge was <unk> because out of N big board common stocks traded during the day only seven were closed and were n't reopened before the close

 a house-senate conference approved a permanent smoking ban on all domestic airline routes within the continental u.s. and on all flights of six hours or less to alaska and hawaii 
 the restrictions would cover all but a small percentage of domestic air traffic and represent a major expansion of the current smoking ban on flights of two hours or less 
 the exemption allowed on longer flights to alaska and hawaii appears to be largely a <unk> <unk> for the traditionally powerful tobacco industry which has found itself increasingly isolated in the face of public pressure in recent years 
 by a N margin house negotiators initially rejected last night a senate provision covering all domestic flights 
 but the <unk> compromise was soon agreed to in subsequent discussions 
 as a practical matter flights from the west coast to hawaii would be covered as they are under the time limit but the language would exempt longer routes beginning for example in chicago or on the east coast 
 within the senate the ban has had aggressive support from sen. frank <unk> d. n.j. who has used his position as a senate appropriations subcommittee chairman to <unk> votes for the initiative 
 the measure is attached to the more than $ N billion fiscal N transportation bill within mr. <unk> 's jurisdiction and the final compromise is <unk> with more than $ N million in road projects earmarked by members as well as funds sought by major airports including denver 
 from the outset the tobacco industry has been uncertain as to what strategy to follow 
 but the industry retains support in the house leadership through the influence of grower states such as north carolina 
 majority whip william gray owes a political debt to southern agriculture lawmakers for his rise in the house and the philadelphia democrat used his position in the conference to salvage the exemption from a total ban 
 although the smoking provision has attracted the most public interest the underlying bill was the subject of <unk> lobbying because of its impact on air transportation and the more mundane but politically important projects of members 
 in a stark lesson in the power of the appropriations committees the house deliberately killed a handful of projects backed by lawmakers in florida illinois and pennsylvania who had voted against the panel leadership on the house floor 
 anybody can vote as they want said rep. william lehman d. fla. head of the house conferees 
 but if you make a request you should support the committee 
 within the federal aviation administration the final bill promises to increase spending for facilities and equipment by more than N N from last year and total operations would rise to $ N billion a N N boost 
 the facilities account includes $ N million for denver 's ambitious new airport and the competition for these funds created shifting alliances between urban lawmakers representing established airports in philadelphia and michigan and the major carriers to denver united and continental 
 leery of the costs and critics say competition the airlines have sought to gain leverage over the city of denver 
 texas air corp. which owns continental and the air transport association were prominent in the lobbying 
 the industry sought to impose conditions that would have delayed funds for the project until denver and the airlines had agreed to leases for N N of the gates 
 but this was rejected in favor of much <unk> language <unk> the transportation department to review the costs of the first phase expected to cost about $ N billion 
 though smaller in total dollars the conference agreed to preserve an estimated $ N million in controversial subsidies to carriers serving rural or isolated airports 
 the sum is more than double what the house had approved for the program but the list of qualified airports would be cut by N under new distance requirements and limits on the level of subsidy 
 congress previously cut six airports this year 
 the impact of the changes is to eliminate many of the most excessive cases where the government has been paying more than $ N for each passenger in subsidies 
 among rail and highway accounts the agreement provides $ N million for <unk> including $ N million for capital improvements

 the setback in which treasury bond prices plummeted reflected a rebound in the stock market and profit-taking 
 it was a pretty wild day 
 our markets were closely tied to the stock market said joel <unk> manager of trading at smith barney harris upham & co 
 friday 's flight to quality was no longer needed once the stock market found its <unk> he said 
 some fixed-income investors had expected a further drop in stock prices after the nearly <unk> drop in the dow jones industrial average on friday 
 that caused investors to <unk> stocks and buy high-quality treasury bonds which are safer than other types of securities

 some traders said the high-yield market was helped by active institutional buying 
 in particular they said firms such as first boston corp. and drexel burnham lambert inc. began making a market in junk issues early in the session when prices hit severely depressed levels

 the <unk> is <unk> back to black and white says richard <unk> the general manager of eastman kodak co. 's professional photography division 
 until two years ago sales of black-and-white film had been declining steadily since the 1960s 
 but last year buoyed by increased use in advertising and other commercial applications sales increased N N and they are expected to jump at least that much again this year 
 photographic companies are scrambling to tap the <unk> market <unk> some black-and-white product lines and developing new ones

 the biggest <unk> of the black-and-white revival is likely to be international paper co. 's <unk> division known in the industry for its premium products

 we wanted to highlight the individual not the environment he says and black and white allows you to do that better than color 
 the campaign won a <unk> award as this year 's best ad by a specialty retailer

 one big obstacle is that few <unk> develop the film anymore 
 typically it must be <unk> to a handful of processors and may take a week or more to be processed and returned 
 black-and-white film costs consumers a little less than color film and processing costs the same 
 but for <unk> developing costs for black-and-white film are higher 
 some companies are starting to tackle that problem

 they cite the emergence of still electronic photography more newspapers turning to color on their pages and <unk> improvements in the quality of color prints 
 black and white has n't made the same quantum <unk> in technological development as color says mr. butler of the rochester institute 
 the color print today is far superior to prints of N years ago 
 you ca n't say the same with black and white 
 but when popular photography a leading magazine for <unk> selected N of the greatest photos ever made for its latest issue celebrating photography 's <unk> anniversary all were black and white

 while friday 's plunging stock market prompted new fears about the economy 's prospects a <unk> indicator that has <unk> <unk> the economy 's ups and <unk> by exceptionally long lead times points to a sustained rise in overall business activity 
 the barometer developed by analysts at columbia university 's center for international business cycle research here reached a record high of N in august the latest month available and the columbia researchers estimate that it has moved even higher since then 
 the latest reading of N was up from N in july and N as recently as march 
 the august rise marked the fifth straight monthly gain for the indicator which uses the N average as a base of N 
 in contrast the commerce department 's widely followed index of leading indicators while up in august has fallen repeatedly since reaching a high early this year 
 its <unk> behavior through much of N has prompted some <unk> to anticipate the start of a new recession perhaps before year 's end 
 but the far stronger showing of the columbia index makes a recession any time soon highly unlikely says <unk> h. moore the director of the columbia facility 
 a leading authority on the business cycle mr. moore also is a member of the business cycle dating group the panel of private economists that decides for the government when <unk> and recessions begin and end 
 the group normally <unk> only when a change in the economy 's general course seems likely 
 no meeting is scheduled because the expansion shows no sign of going off the tracks mr. moore reports 
 based largely on the recent strength in their index called the long leading indicator the columbia analysts <unk> <unk> economic growth through the rest of this year and next year as well 
 they expect a N N rise in N in the gross national product after adjustment for inflation 
 underlying this optimism is the index 's longstanding ability to signal recessions or <unk> as the case may be by substantially greater periods than the commerce department 's index of leading indicators 
 over the full <unk> war ii era the columbia index on the average has entered sustained declines N months before the <unk> of recessions and turned up eight months before <unk> 
 the comparable lead times for the commerce index whose components include the stock market are far shorter N months before recessions and only three months before <unk> 
 the columbia economists also have <unk> how the long leading index would have behaved had it existed in N before the stock market crash in october that <unk> in the great depression 
 the indicator reached a peak in january N and then fell steadily up to and through the crash 
 it was an entirely different pattern from what we 're seeing now mr. moore says 
 a major source of the recent strength in the long leading indicator has been the performance of the dow jones corporate <unk> index which is not a part of the commerce index 
 in august the bond measure was at its highest monthly average since early N 
 it also rose last friday while the stock market sagged 
 other components of the long leading indicator include a ratio of prices to unit labor costs in manufacturing industries the <unk> version of the money supply adjusted for inflation and the volume of new <unk> permits 
 notably <unk> from the columbia index is the stock market which mr. moore says is simply no longer such a good indicator of the economy 's <unk> prospects though it still is useful for anticipating some <unk> <unk> and turns 
 as recently as N the stock market as reflected in the standard & poor 's index of N common stocks was rated by the national bureau of economic research as the best of the N leading indicators that then made up the commerce index 
 it was assigned a mark of N out of a possible N compared with scores ranging as low as N for the other components 
 the stock market has lost some <unk> power analysts at the columbia center claim because of the growing impact of international developments 
 stocks have become more sensitive to factors not directly tied to the domestic economy mr. moore says citing the exchange rate for the dollar on currency markets the <unk> balance and inflows of foreign capital 
 he also feels that the rise of such <unk> practices as program trading has diminished the stock market 's <unk> to the economic outlook

 this is the place that world opinion has been celebrating over in the expectation that it 's going to hold an election

 mr. stanley is on trial over charges that he violated a <unk> issued by the south african administrator general earlier this year which made it a crime punishable by two years in prison for any person to <unk> <unk> or <unk> the election commission 
 the stanley affair does n't <unk> well for the future of democracy or freedom of anything in namibia when swapo starts running the government 
 to the extent mr. stanley has done anything wrong it may be that he is out of step with the consensus of world intellectuals that the <unk> guerrillas were above all else the victims of <unk> by neighboring south africa 
 swapo has enjoyed favorable western media treatment ever since the u.n. general assembly declared it the sole <unk> representative of namibia 's people in

 commodity futures prices generally reflected the stability of the stock market following its plunge friday 
 yesterday the stock market 's influence at first created nervousness 
 later however it became more of an <unk> than a <unk> force as individual markets reacted more to their own factors 
 gold the traditional haven in times of financial crisis continued its <unk> <unk> with the dollar rising early in the day as the currency fell and then giving up some of its gains as the dollar recovered 
 copper and crude oil reacted sharply to the concern that a crash yesterday could have a potentially devastating effect on the economy 
 copper fell and showed little rebound through the day as one of the major supply problems that had been supporting prices appeared to be solved 
 crude oil declined early but as the stock market retained early gains it too became stronger ending with a small net loss 
 trading in cotton and sugar was nervous and showed small declines 
 in chicago grain and soybean prices rose slightly 
 livestock and meat prices however dropped on concern that a financial crisis would cut consumption of beef and pork 
 in commodity markets yesterday precious metals futures prices were moderately higher as gold gave up some of its early gains and platinum behaved <unk> first falling and then later rising

 december silver was up N cents an ounce at $ N 
 platinum behaved more like an industrial metal easing early on concern over a possible weaker economy but recovering later as the stock market strengthened 
 gold was nowhere the spectacular performer it was two years ago on black monday 
 for one thing last friday precious metals markets closed before the stock market went into its <unk> nose dive so it could n't react to it 
 back on friday oct. N <unk> the stock market declined during the day and gold prices surged as the stock market fell 
 the october N contract that day rose as much as $ N to as high as $ N and the more deferred positions due to mature as late as march N rose as much as $ N 
 on black monday oct. N N the october contract tacked on further gains rising to as high as $ N for a gain of almost $ N on top of the friday advances before giving up almost $ N of that at the close 
 yesterday 's october gain of $ N was <unk> compared with that 
 one analyst peter <unk> of <unk> & co. new york said the gold market already had some good <unk> technical factors that would have caused prices to rise with or without the stock market 
 what the stock market did was cause the rise to take place earlier than it would have happened said mr. <unk> 
 there 's a good chance that gold will retain its gains and rise further he said 
 he expects a drop in interest rates which would help gold by keeping the dollar from rising 
 finally according to mr. <unk> the impact of the strong dollar should be reflected in reduced exports in the august merchandise trade deficit when the figures are released today 
 this would be damaging to the dollar and supportive for gold he said

 worried that friday 's 190-point stock market plunge might be a <unk> of things to come for the economy petroleum futures traders called a halt to the recent string of increases in crude oil futures prices 
 the u.s. benchmark crude west texas intermediate closed at $ N a barrel for november delivery down N cents 
 some analysts said crude was due for a correction <unk> following several days of significant gains 
 but most market observers agreed that friday 's stock market drop is what <unk> spirits in the petroleum pits yesterday 
 until yesterday futures prices had been headed up on expectations that world oil demand will continue to be strong 
 the organization of petroleum exporting countries increased its production ceiling for the fourth quarter based on projections of robust demand 
 so any bearish indicator such as friday 's <unk> drop in the stock market sends <unk> through the oil markets as well 
 indeed after reacting early in the trading day to friday 's plummet futures prices firmed up again as traders took note of the stock market 's partial recovery yesterday 
 copper

 the december contract declined N cents a pound to $ N 
 prices were down from the outset of trading on concern that a drop in the stock market might create a weakened economy and a <unk> reduction in copper use

 britain 's blue arrow plc intends to change its name to manpower plc and write off a chunk of the nearly $ N billion in good will realized in the takeover of <unk> manpower inc 
 blue arrow chairman mitchell fromstein said in an interview that the two steps may be a prelude to <unk> the world 's biggest <unk> group in the u.s. 
 mr. fromstein disclosed the planned steps expected within a few months as blue arrow posted a N N drop in its third-quarter pretax earnings 
 the name change and good will write-off could help <unk> blue arrow 's dominance of the u.s. <unk> market and give it a more american image as u.s. investors turn jittery about foreign stocks after friday 's market plunge 
 u.s. holders now own more than N N of blue arrow compared with N N last january 
 in the u.s. market the recognition of the manpower name is <unk> stronger than blue arrow mr. fromstein said 
 the moves also could <unk> shareholders ' perception of blue arrow as a company in turmoil 
 it further <unk> the concept that blue arrow is a thing of the past said doug arthur an analyst at kidder peabody & co. in new york 
 the proposed changes all make a lot of sense to me he added 
 in a widely publicized <unk> coup mr. fromstein ousted <unk> berry as blue arrow chief executive in january a month after mr. berry had forced mr. fromstein out as the $ N <unk> chief of <unk> manpower 
 mr. fromstein <unk> his control in april by taking over from mr. berry as chairman 
 but the blue arrow <unk> is n't over yet as the british government is investigating a disputed # N million $ N million loan which mr. fromstein has said was made under mr. berry 's direction 
 blue arrow was able to pull off the $ N billion takeover of manpower in N largely because different british and american accounting standards produce higher reported earnings for british companies 
 under british rules blue arrow was able to write off at once the $ N billion in good will arising from the purchase 
 as a <unk> company blue arrow would have to <unk> the good will over as many as N years creating a continuing drag on reported earnings 
 good will is the excess of cost of an acquired firm operating unit or assets over the current or fair market value of those assets 
 but with so many shares now held in the u.s. blue arrow reports its earnings two ways based on both u.k. and u.s. accounting standards 
 our balance sheets look like they came from alice 's <unk> mr. fromstein said 
 the british version shows a handful of pounds of net worth following the N write-off of good will while the american version reflects $ N billion of net worth because almost none of the good will has been written off 
 mr. fromstein said he hopes to <unk> some of the good will left on blue arrow 's u.s. books in one fell <unk> but would n't specify how much 
 people close to blue arrow suggested the write-down would represent a sizable chunk with executives claiming prior management <unk> the extent of manpower 's good will 
 that move along with the return to the manpower name could bolster the company 's prospects during possibly difficult times for temporary help 
 the number of u.s. temporary workers fell about N N in the N months ending aug. N after sliding nearly N N in july said kidder peabody 's mr. arthur 
 blue arrow blamed the pretax profit drop in the quarter ended july N partly on slower earnings growth of <unk> units in britain 
 overall pretax profit slid to # N million in the quarter from # N million a year earlier

 last year 's earnings of $ N million including $ N from a restructuring gain were far below the year-earlier $ N million 
 besides spurring barry wright 's sales which were $ N million in N mr. sim must <unk> its costs and product line 
 the question is how long it 's going to take barry wright to make a contribution says f. john <unk> an analyst at blunt ellis <unk> in milwaukee 
 the answer will help determine whether applied continues to reach the ambitious goals set by mr. sim 
 the butler wis. manufacturer went public at $ N a share in august N and mr. sim 's goal then was a $ N per-share price by N 
 strong earnings growth helped achieve that price far ahead of schedule in august N
