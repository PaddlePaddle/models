# knowledge_distillation

## 1、Introduction
Model ensemble can improve the generalization of MRC models. However, such approach is not efficient. Because the inference of an ensemble model is slow and a huge amount of resources are required. We leverage the technique of distillation to ensemble multiple models into a single model solves the problem of slow inference process.

## 2、Quick Start

### Environment
- Python >= 2.7
- cuda >= 9.0
- cudnn >= 7.0
- PaddlePaddle >= 1.6 Please refer to Installation Guide [Installation Guide](http://www.paddlepaddle.org/#quick-start)

### Data and Models Preparation
User can get the data and trained knowledge_distillation models directly we provided: 
```
bash wget_models_and_data.sh
```
user can get data and models directorys: 

data: 

./data/input/mlm_data: mask language model dataset.

./data/input/mrqa_distill_data: mrqa dataset, it includes two parts: mrqa_distill.json(json data we calculate from teacher models), mrqa-combined.all_dev.raw.json(merge all mrqa dev dataset). 

./data/input/mrqa_evaluation_dataset: mrqa evaluation data(in_domain data and out_of_domain json data).

models: 

./data/pretrain_model/squad2_model: pretrain model(google squad2.0 model as pretrain model [Model Link](https://worksheets.codalab.org/worksheets/0x3852e60a51d2444680606556d404c657)).

./data/saved_models/knowledge_distillation_model: baidu trained knowledge distillation model.

## 3、Train and Predict
Train and predict  knowledge distillation model
```
bash run_distill.sh
```

## 4、Evaluation
To evaluate the result, run
```
sh run_evaluation.sh
```
Note that we use the evaluation script for SQuAD 1.1 here, which is equivalent to the official one.

## 5、Performance

|  | dev in_domain(Macro-F1)| dev out_of_domain(Macro-F1) |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Official baseline | 77.87 | 58.67 |
| KD(4 teacher model-> student)| 83.67 | 67.34 |

KD: knowledge distillation model(ensemble 4 teacher models to student model)
