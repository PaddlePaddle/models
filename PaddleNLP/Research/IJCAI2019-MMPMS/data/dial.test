according to the literature that this community basically accepts as gospel , the wall is usually at 23 . saying it 's 30 or more is accounting for outliers .	the wall varies . i personally know a woman who is 36 and has yet to hit the wall . actually looks stunning if that 's the word . depends a lot on their lifestyle day in and day out .
and that kakuna is n't even alive anymore . all has gone to shit . the thing we fought so hard for is dead and all the deaths were meaningless .	as is war sometimes . again , this is a much darker tale . i feel as if their will be more casualties later on into the game

what movie is this from ?	big hero 6 .
that sounds like an awesome night !	haha indeed it was ! all week i 've been in a great mood . for whatever reason i feel more confident since then !

cannot tell you how many family members who did n't go to college openly criticize my choice to go to grad school as a waste of time .	i did go to grad school . in terms of improving you earnings , it probably is a waste of time . in terms of putting off the real world , though , it works wonders .
is that a wood brothers car in the penske shop ?	yes , i was surprised to see it in there . i mean it is a ford , and it 's penske 's driver , but still . maybe the wood brothers are letting penske prepare the 500 car .
to be fair carter was one of the worst presidents ever .	to be fair , he was an ineffective president . bush jr . was more effective , and far worse .

i plan on watching whiplash tonight . will this short film spoil plot points from the feature , or is it completely different ?	the short is pretty much a carbon copy of one of the earlier scenes in the movie . there are n't any major plot points that get soiled , it 's mainly just establishing fletcher 's character .
i hope the new dudes use double character text for all their trolling .	that makes me want to start typing all of my shit in double char .
is that the show with brand new ? i 'm going to get a hotel for four different shows that week . i would n't mind other people crashing .	nooooo , that 's not til wednesday . ah i remember talking to you about that ! i decided to drive up to slo to see bts headline instead of open . which other shows are you going to ?

les - be - honest , we 're all waiting for the sequel !	i 've already agreed to see it in the theater with my wife and one of our friends . the first movie was fun ! i would n't buy it , but i wo n't turn down watching it .
18 million sounds so cheap , yet i consider the effects in that movie to be incredibly on par with today 's movies with ridiculously higher budgets .	i never watched it . is it a cult classic ? is it like me not watching the matrix for 10 years ?
hey , anything to justify having a fat wife i guess .	what 's wrong with having a fat wife ? fat chicks can be pretty hot .

why would they be dating them if they were boring and ugly ? you usually know that right away . it 's usually at least slightly more complicated than that .	so you never get bored of something you used to like ?
what ? edit : the flair makes this comment pretty confusing . they play against us	so . our time will come . i know it . the sens have been a good story and actually showing a will to play . they 'll be a fun ride if they can get past us

vanilla wow resto druids were a joke at best . one rez on a 20 or 30 minute cd , as well as hots that did n't work all that well and were a mega drain on mana .	their raid healing was great though , far superior to a priest who were considered the best all around healers back then .
type - c can be directly and passively converted to displayport , so at least it 's compatible - ish with existing cinema displays .	displayport alternate mode is not supported in every computer . it would be interesting to know if this macbook does . in that case the apple adapter is a generic type - c to hdmi converter .

sadly , i do n't know of anyone where it 's gone away . we all learn to cope and keep exercising .	we can only live in hope .
i work with a guy who simply refuses to watch breaking bad like the rest of the world . i hope one day he watches it , has his mind blown and feels like an idiot for not getting involved earlier	god my brother is like this too and i have no idea why . he says its not a shoe he can get in to , even though he watches sons of anarchy , weeds , dexter , and similar shows . it drives me nuts .
this is the middle ages . you marry for babies and that 's about it .	more importantly you marry for political allies or advantage . though babies are a part of that as well .

please delete this post .	why are you fucking forum police ? do me a favour and fuck off and cry
and they said hillary would win handily in 2007 too .	she would have won the presidency if not for obama 's better primary campaign . also , this is not about what he said or she said , this is about data we have now .
i am on a high server . i find guns constantly . mostly pistols . craft the upgraded bow , and try to hunt players . its fun to get bow kills .	grats on your luck , i do n't mind an hour gearing up . but 4 and still not getting there is a bit much .
seems pretty clear the way he was able to hand over his diving licence straight away and the way that he did it in .	are you seriously saying that having a drivers license within reach is proof that it 's fake ?

i 've had the unlock slash not unlock happen in my 2010 before . it always happens when i have a power adaptor plugged in . unplugging it before turning the car off makes it work as usual .	interesting , where was the adapter plugged in at ?
i 'm not sure about your lifestyle , but many people do not have the money to move to a different house at will . even if their lives are in danger .	if this guy is lucky he 'll get enough donations to move his family out

the devs themselves said that the payout of an average game should scale to the time spent in classic playing x many games .	yes , but that wo n't apply to all play styles . definitely , rails are very different in this meta
gfy bud .	i do n't really agree with your response to him . you 're a public figure , bro . and i respect you , but that was n't called for
people shit on dane cook because he stole jokes but he is at least a good performer . most of his material is n't very good at all but he still makes it funny .	who did he steal jokes from ? i 've heard this so many times . i 've heard most of dane cook 's material and have never heard it from anyone else . seems like a circlejerk to me .

how does one go about getting this job ? it would be amazing to test drive cars that are not released yet .	most of the time it 's not cool cars , and it 's usually the same boring loop over and over and over again . roush does a lot of oem test driving . there 's a lot done in house as well .
they could n't offer him a competitive salary though , which is why he turned it down .	he turned it down because he did n't see as much of a future in it as much as casting . riot is offering salaries for coaches this year , so money would n't really have been a problem .

then why play group stages or qualifiers at all . just put eg in the grand finals , right ? now shut the fk up .	quite honestly , it 's not like that 's not going to happen . trough i guess ppd could be less of an ass over it .
i think i have to do a no buy as well . we can be no buy buddies	i think i need a no buy buddy . i 'm so bad at it .
thanks . do you know if the high number of faults after upgrading to yosemite is a concern ?	i do n't know , but i do n't think so . the number is usually high for me after a longer uptime of the system , and i have enough ram installed . if you do n't see problems i would n't worry .

a few of your comments were removed because i considered them to be personal information .	your killing me for your own paranoia without asking a single public record question , about why i have a right to talk professionally about personal emotion work .
compatible sizes : 1 - 3 and type just gun	yes , the wing mounts are size 3 , fixed only . put a couple mantis or tarantula on them and have fun !
klein is definitely in the physical , defensive category . his offense this year is a pleasant surprise , but he is counted on for his defense , not his offense .	yeah he 's most definitely not an offensive defenseman .

awesome book series . i only own a ancient philosophy and anthropology	i 've read a ton of those too . awesome series .

i think about justin beiber so much that even though the name of his movie is a very common phrase , he is the first thing that comes to mind when hearing it ! you stop giving him attention !	wow , i did n't even know he had a movie and i actually like some of his music . amazing that a hater is more obsessed with him than an actual fan .
sounds like you could be an investor if you have the money . why not start a restaurant ?	i know of chefs getting work visas , so maybe is just a matter of finding some restaurant to sponsor him .

i like how even isaiah getting left off the dream team goes back to michael jordan being a dick . he has way too many dickish stories .	there was nobody on that team that wanted isiah on it . jordan is a dick , but that has nothing to do with this story , since the problem is that isiah was an even bigger dick .

yeah , but what if he was a straight alien ? would you be surprised then ?	not if that 's how the female form of his species actually looks .

if you only taught the class for fun and access to the library resources , i ca n't imagine the review was that far off .	i believe that is unfair , my grandfather taught a few classes at ucla both because he loved to teach , and the access to the academic environment was a nice bonus .
how much do you figure it 'll cost when it becomes tradeable in a million years ?	considering the number of people who bought the compendium in just a short amount of time , not much
his australian accent was the worst thing in that movie . totally took me out of it . just awful .	the guy brings us phenomenal films . let him have a shitty performance in any one of his movies he wants .
i hope they made him pay for the repairs . was definitely intentional	ceiling tile are n't that expensive , honestly would cost about 20 - 30 bucks . assuming he didnt damage the wood on the floor but ya he could still pay for it .
people over 65 vote at twice the rate of people under 35 . so they get more influence in our government . whose fault is that ?	the fucked up ancient system of scheduling votes ?
his fight took me a super long time but only like 3 or 4 tries because it was totally a game of being careful , saving vials , and parrying at the right times .	you can beat him as long as he does n't shoot twice in row .
i just do n't see why i have to do everything . it 's illogical that in dead island i 'm the one who does everything on my own , i should have ai players with me on these quests .	i think it 's completely fine if the game 's challenges have priority over the logic of the world . not every game must be about realism .
same . i used an anti - material rifle and it felt too easy .	silenced anti - material rifle , with high sneak and explosive rounds . i have no shame .
not mine . he 's hella easy .	lucky you . mine needs play time , affection , safety consciousness and a host of other things .
i followed him for maybe 5 minutes .	i followed him for about half an hour hoping something else would happen or he 'd arrive somewhere . then i murdered him and stole his scooter . i killed my brother . i am a monster .
i too have an enormous iranian nose . i mean , you could do what most do and get a nose job . it is n't a big deal .	it 's not the size that bothers me at all though . just the kink . if i were to get a surgery , i would n't touch anything else !
he has a good chin , but tonight was all gas tank .	yeah he can definitely take the shots , though 5 or 6 heavy rights and well placed body shot 'll put away some of the best .
my so is the opposite , if she loses she 'll want to play again immediately . she does n't lose often . she 's a strategic force to be reckoned with .	ha same thing with my fiance . he plays games until he beats me then he is usually done with it
antarctica .	almost certainly the continent with the highest mean level of education , given the number of researchers .
i recall a story in the news , several years ago , of a woman who gave birth to twins . one white , one black . they had two different fathers . she ended up a single mom .	there was a case some years ago with triplets . black , white , and asian . mom was a hooker working a business convention .
are you referring to encrypted manuals like the holy bible , the quran , the book of mormon , and chicken noodle soup for the soul ? good luck understanding those .	i recently tried the holy bible but i 'm having trouble figuring out what i have to do to get high afterlife levels .
while you were playing it cool , she clearly came .	i had to turn down my volume quicker than lightning .
yes you are n't going to get ripped off . they pay out	they pay out to an extent . do n't expect to win 20k and cash out .
wait , it 's not ?	no . why would kevin be in the same room as a production member ?
do you object to the fact that women were encouraged to pursue medicine and law , so that now a majority off law and med students are female ?	do you think it 's a bad thing that a majority of law and med students are female ?
the plot twist of talia was n't told by anyone until they filmed the scene in the dark knight rises . was n't even written in the script .	that explains why it felt pretty shoehorned in .
well jimmy novak is confirmed dead . so that 's not happening . it 's not jimmy novak 's body anymore .	yeah i know jimmy is dead but sam and dean have died multiple times only to be brought back by cas and other angels . what 's stopping him from bringing back jimmy for claire ?
50 cent seems like a dick to me .	he 's funny as fuck tho . i 'm sure id be rolling
wow . for the record , that 's the absolute opposite of what i have in mind .	except the naked boobs part , right ?
if you think i come inequality is a problem and not a sign of progress in ending poverty , not only do you lack an education in economics , but i doubt you are a libertarian	there was plenty of income inequality during feudalism too . libertarian does n't mean anarchy .
everyone gives me credit for that . i wish they gave me credit for how badly they want my penis inside them .	true , please cock me sir .
i do n't fucking play football , it 's a dumb game .	you 're the most effective troll i 've seen in a long time .
mana transfer scene where ?	look , i love mana dolphins as much as the next guy but i do n't think there is a person watching that show that does n't know it was adapted from a h - game . lol
you say that as a joke but they literally forgot the month of december in one of the android releases .	nobody ever really works or plans things in december anyway , so they figured they did n't need it . santa complained , so it made it in the next release .
actually india . indonesia is the largest muslim majority country though .	i do n't understand how indonesia has a higher percentage than sa . i 'd be willing to bet not many people there will admit to not believing islam .
only problem i foresee , the license plate is not visible in the video	if you rewind a bit before the video is set to start you can see on the cab the company logo , and all the other numbers on the side .
militant vegans . you hear about them all the time on reddit but in reality it 's just some guy being teased by his friends and politely declining .	one of my good friend 's sisters is a militant vegan . she used to get in our faces when we would grill out so i started whipping raw meat at her . she does n't bug us anymore .
well it already gives zero fucks . if it had less then it 's just taking away other people 's fucks	nah , it runs a fuck deficit . what you gunna do , make it pay up ?
is acu worth picking up now for this price ?	i just picked it up last week and i 'm enjoying it but the framerate is crazy . sometimes i 'm running at 60 then suddenly drop to 20 fps
enzo does n't nothing in the ring he 's awful	he 's fairly basic in the ring , but i think his charisma will get him over , and i think a tag team is the perfect spot for him .
while cool , this might be the most boring leaked info ever .	dude its a joke , the rifle is the storm trooper weapon and in the films they have 0 accuracy
totally understandable , but you got through it and that 's what counts ! how was the movie ?	the movie was a lot of fun . i 'm actually planning on going out again before next weekend ! i 'm making serious progress .
guys it 's happening . front porch , beer , headphones , beautiful weather . life is good friends . stay royal .	headphones ? why are you depriving your neighbors of the awesomeness that is the kansas city royals ? let that shit play out loud !
auto shotgun beats it most of the time if there 's no passenger in the car .	yeah , best way to deal with a kuruma is a bullet to the driver 's dome . hard to pull off reliably , but satisfying .
watching on nbc live extra . commercial breaks are fucking killing me .	the split - screen with race coverage and commercials is one thing , the full commercials breaks are unacceptable . really disappointing . it 's so sporadic .
plot twist : ops friend is a guy .	double twist : the brother is post - op and therefore the sister now .
i was referring to why do i have skype installed in the first place , since i do n't talk to anybody on it .	it is cheaper than actual phone . i often have to call abroad , and then it is really cheaper .
yeah your right alot of their feats dont add up . and that thing with the weights in other world always annoyed me .	yeah and was it 40 tons compared to the planets gravity or earth ? was other world 's gravity the same as earth ? i wish there were more feats of strength .
i 'm pretty much indifferent to the fact what he did previously , what he does now is do pro - apple biased reviews .	yeah , pro - apple biased reviews with statements the iphone 6 looks like android phones and the plastic lines on the back looked ugly compared to the m8 .
bought a nice little keyboard for my ipad . the novelty quickly wore off .	same . i 'm glad it wore off in about 2 weeks so i was able to return it .
i know , i found one yesterday , do they ever despawn if they are placed down , or do they stay permanently ?	they stay on public , i believe the current timer for untouched is like 10 days . but for most part if you actively use it , it should n't despawn unless there is a server wipe .
i thought he did n't get shot , hmmmm	a bag of groceries would n't stop a bullet .
you would call 911 if you saw a naked broad dancing happily on her balcony ? by the time she actually climbed on the railing it would have been far too late to do anything .	so what would you do in that situation ? pick up your phone and click on the camera ? just seeing a woman on her balcony aim to jump would disturb me for a long time . just my opinion .
what if the pens lost the draft lottery and did n't get crosby ? we 'd probably be talking about the kansas city penguins right now .	anaheim would look drastically different . would they have won the cup in 07 ? would they have been able to keep getz and perry ? how many more goals would teemu have scored ?
no expense is peanuts when you have zero revenue .	i 'm not sure you realize that when huge funds keep putting tons of money into your idea . that 's basically their business model .
isnt that why you would get the it with a docking station with a second monitor ? i know the pro 3 supports up to two additional monitors at 1080p each i believe .	i do n't need my editing workstation to be portable though , and i 'm sure as hell not working on 8gb . psd 's on an atom processor instead of my desktop .
if i were n't broke as hell i 'd give you gold for that pun .	so would i . can we at least give him silver ?
two rats fuckin in a wool sock ?	two hippos 69 'ing in a sewer drain
did anyone else think this was weird ? why was the girl so afraid of her dad ?	you 're the only one who thinks that , go watch a sunset or something the world is a happier place then you think .
good , now bring this mode over to the iphone where only basic cellular function can be done .	i swear i put my iphone into something like this one day at work . not airplane mode , i could have sworn there was a banner text saying power reserve . have n't been able to do it again though .
i bought the majority of my champions with rp . like 5 out of the 110 or something i own , were bought with ip . i 'm a lazy bastard who ca n't be bothered waiting for ip	what the hell do you spend ip on ? do you buy ridiculous amounts of runes ? are you rich and only playing for a short time ?
another day in high school .	absolutely . it was my last period of the day , a computer - oriented class .
in russia i hear people install cameras on their cars because insurance fraud is a thing there . maybe people in the us should start doing that for cop encounters .	i have one in my car not specifically for police interactions , but just in case someone does something stupid and causes a car accident .
steve carell will always be michael to me . it 's a shame - he 's actually a good actor . michael 's not what he 's like , it 's a character .	have you seen foxcatcher ? it 's kinda slow , but damn if he is n't a completely different person entirely
a big part of it is that he 's white , i guarantee it .	hey man , if ty lawson says you get laid , who are we to question ?
and just dumps it in the water !	trash island !
size ?	medium !
the pirate and bounty hunter expansion adds a lot of player interaction . i 'm not big on direct conflict so it 's not for me . but it does its job .	i 've heard similar things but it 's kind of crummy that you need expansions to make a game decent . sounds a like bad design smell to me !

bring some fried chicken for a snack . and talk through the whole movie , it 's what mlk would have wanted .	pop a few caps at the screen and talk real loud .
everyone learned that , when every sports site on earth reported the shit out of it last week .	op 's post is factually correct and your comment is n't .
i would n't be too sure . how long have people been saying that sharp is gonna get traded ? and it still has n't happened yet .	because we do n't need it to happen until next year when we start to have cap issues
a innocent question : does the beta progress carry over to the release version ?	there 'll be a complete wipe , but closed beta players will likely receive a premium ship and other goodies for playing many matches in cb .
yeah , me too , accidentally fell asleep too right after i said that . right now i can .	ah i 'm out right now . can you perhaps do it later tonight again ? given that i do n't fall asleep
i 've loved their duo streams the last few nights . awesome to see sneaky helping incarnation fit in . he even said that he and meteos took him to chipotle the other day	is n't this going a bit too fast ?
you can do cardio after smoking ? much respect .	i do n't smoke cigarette , never have and i vape . do n't know if that makes a difference ?
keycaps are usually always from the mechanical keyboard community not the console community . if that 's actually where it came from , it only makes it even funnier .	yup . there was a vote going on way back about which console to drop . brick and potato votes were added which eventually lead to these keycap drops . if i recall correctly .
you like candy ?	gummy bears !

right . right . whatever you say , man . this is so fucking absurd , i 'm convinced this is very covert sarcasm .	i was hoping it was obvious boomer steve .
no . do all men have faith , or do only the elect have faith ?	only the elect are given faith to exercise . and the object of that faith is jesus christ and him crucified and risen again .
thanks . you 're the only person who posted a working stream . idk why people post links to streams that do n't work .	no problem . i always share whatever i find . i 'm not usually the one to find them though . haha . it 's a relatively stable stream too .
this is further supported by how long button was able to keep perez behind him in aus , despite being 2 - 3 seconds per lap slower once perez got by !	all perez had to do was wait for drs on the pit straight and it would have been an easy overtake with that much of a power difference but he of course had to try a stupid move .
team b is in the championship no matter how many points they score so long as they get more than 7 . can someone explain how team b according to op would n't want to score points .	if team b scores 15 points the bottom team of the three will be team c . it would then go to the head to head between a and b , which b lost .
what the fuck is mexican coke ?	mexican coke is coca cola from mexico , apparently it tastes better than what we make in america due to the type of sugar we use in it i guess ?
explain your way of measuring a coastline and we 'll see how hard maths crush it .	i thought you would just walk and count the distance in miles it takes to go either around or till the end of the coast line . especially easier if you have a small island
tis 'the pressers who hold us all back from achieving a true goal of 0000 . they are weak and must not be praised for their actions against the greater good .	you 're just as bad as us , you ca n't resist the urge of knowing what happens after 000 .
i thought i 'd seen unique closed ? please tell me i 'm mistaken .	the one in portland did but the one on preston is still open . if i just needed one suit i 'd be all over either goodwill or unique .
one of my favorites was the final fight in jet li 's fearless . i ca n't seem to find a good version of the scene on youtube , but it is probably somewhere else online .	the sword scene did it for me in that movie .
does that mean war snipers will have a youtube channel ? or are you posting on a personal channel ?	i do n't really see the scope for a channel , so i 'll post it onto my personal page .
learn something new every day , i did not know that . thank you for the clear explanation . my mistake .	i have a tendency to stick the oxford comma in places it simply does n't belong . it 's something i actually have to watch when writing . otherwise , i end up with sentences , like this .
got 7 new avatars in the past 2 days . not necessarily a goal but i 'm pretty happy to mark a few off my list . ; d	ooh , that 's great !
i know right ? he gets hit by normal humans , it 's kinda stupid . otherwise its a pretty good show . but then again a girl uses a gun that makes gold to steal shit .	that one i can just chalk up to being fake gold .
at what point do you just take a shower ?	this is what i do , no toilet paper ? looks like i 'm taking a second shower today .
my only beef with our state is the high cost of loving compared to many other states . love it here though .	yeah , the price of prostitutes there is way out of control .
she 's one of my top 5 favorite bodies . love her tan lines .	such an angelic face also . and , from what i 've heard , one of the nicest , most down to earth celebs out there . personally i 'm not a big fan of her tats , but to each his own .
fake , ryu is just photoshop of marth	it has roy in it so it 's real
he was in all - time scoring packs , 2k released them for about 3 days and that 's what happened .	oooh , i was away for a week , i didnt even notice that pack was out .
because the way they set it up is an ethical and legal mess .	ethical , i can see your point but legal mess in what way ? and again , they can release the mod for free . modders are not forced into selling their creations .
it works so well that it even changed the shape of their nose !	and where her eyes sit in relation to the rest of her face .
thank you ! even though i do n't like these people or what happened , it did n't need guns or death involved . im glad they did n't have any as well .	i am happy you 're ok , again , what a shitty experience for you guys .
i just thought it was weird he 's wearing it at 20 . good on you for quitting dude !	i had a friend that wore the same kind of things . almost thought it was him based on the clothes , ring , hand and he 'd be 20 - 21 around now . looks like ops canadian though so ca n't be him
what about health ? do you bring nutrients ?	later in mh3u i carried the max - potion as a sort - of panic button . food is enough to buff your health near max .
i feel your pain mate that 's what i use and it can be a bit of a pain in the arse lol	i 'll use my christmas money to buy an airbrush since my dad already has a compressor . i 'll have to wait a few months though .
thank you for the help ! do you know when you get an orientation date or do you have to book it ?	you do pick a date , but i 'm not sure when you can begin signing up . i think in a couple of months .
1080p 60 fps , until i hit low settings on aaa games . any estimates ?	we hit rock bottom with the new consoles , they will slow down the cycle for a long ass while , you should be good for the rest of the console 's lifetime which usually is 7 years or more .
scot left seattle before we won the super bowl . it 's not like we 've had a hard time operating without him .	he was a scout . his job was to go out and find the players that made up the superbowl team .
went to look for a snack between innings , found a surprise puddle of dog piss , and missed russell 's hr . fuck .	ca n't blame the dog . russell 's hr was rather exciting .
oh sorry . you know how it goes . i answered directly through the inbox and thought you were the person i asked my question in the first place . i guess i should edit my answer in above then ?	all i know is the guy you wanted to reply did n't see your comment so yeah , reply to the right post , do n't worry about these comments .
you 're right - i really mean recreational . i think i will change my op so that it reflects that .	oops - i ca n't change it . i 'll keep it in mind for next time , though .
i have a hard time believing a reader would miss the satire .	many dont . a lot of people i talked to in college basically saw it as the book version of the movie .
why would they comprehend anything after they hit the ground ?	that 's what i 'm saying . what 's the point of injecting them with a drug that will prolong terror , if to then they 'll only have fallen a few feet in slow motion before they die .
where else are you supposed to ride a bicycle ? on the pavement , crashing into pedestrians at 20 - 30 kilometers an hour ?	i thought that was the illegal part , and that you were meant to ride on the road
you 're going to have to ask the jet that .	instructions unclear , got ran over on the airport tarmac while screaming at jet .
try to keep up ? you are already trailing light years behind . anyway , back in your box troll .	ah yes , everyone who disagrees with you is a troll . the conservatives won the last election in case you did n't realise . by your logic you 're closer to being a troll than me .
the islanders to give a proper send off to nassau .	that would be pretty cool . i 'll have to add them to my list . that and johnny . i miss him .
i 'm not the one downvoting you , but i do think this girl has a big butt because she 's overweight . it 's usually pretty easy to tell .	overweight , sure . i guess it 's just semantics on fat for me .
i thought all music was played on radios live . so every time a song is being played , that band is in the radio broadcasting station .	i thought the same thing . my friend thought if you were recording a song off the radio onto cassettes , you had to be quiet or else you would record everything you said
everything under rendering although mines probably a bit different but not home atm so ca n't compare	would u be so kind when u come home to share the rendering part . tnx
did n't he work for rt before slow month guys existed ?	yeah but he could only come to the us for 90 days at a time so he had to get a visa to move here .
cool story , but not how ante works . you ante up before the match , most of the cards that reference ante kind of mention how the ante cards are common knowledge before and during play .	we ante 'd top card face down at the beginning of the game , then whoever won the match won the ante pile .
and how would you cook said ramen without utilities or a home ?	well first you just eat the block of noodles whole . then you snort the seasoning , drink some boiling water then fuck hot bitches to stir it all up inside you . at least that 's how i eat it .

that unicorn mask . and tiki guy !	b - but my cat main is n't a mask : c
how about kessel for rask , rinne for bergeron and datsyuk , kurri , parise and karlsson for chara ? i 'd only need them for a minute as i have rest of the collection done already .	wait i screwed up , i can take that perfectly , i 'm online now . pm me to work it out
this is really sweet , but i 'd be paranoid about my smell	my wife gets me to talk to her while she 's in the bathroom all the time . i do n't have a sense of smell though .
sounds like an interesting 2 player card game . however i find the price too high for a simple card game like this . very disappointing : why is there no print and play level ?	one of the buttons on the campaign page is for a print and play version , which you can get now .
why does that matter ? that is how you scar a child which could cause mental and social issues .	brothers like to mess with their younger siblings . dads like to mess with their sons . relatives just like to mess with relatives . it 's just family man .
sucks , man . but it 'll be there waiting for you if you ever do get one !	i ca n't wait !
if you do n't mind me asking , what time of office job only pays 9 . 33 an hour ?	social work .
where 'd you get your copy of ps ? just torrent it ?	you could do that ; i got mine free through school
we were talking about the law clerks and pi in 2012 . neither side called them , either side could have .	no hang on . it is highly likely the pi or a clerk contacted asia in 1999 . in 2012 the onus was on adnan to produce asia .
do you have a gun ? a big mean dog ? a big mean dog and a gun ?	i have a cat , and a handgun . i used to have two cats , but one went missing in the woods .
good enough to warrant forgiving the super - smug branding ?	good point , but yes good enough
this . and if we happened to be near some other kid 's house around lunch time , his mom or dad would fix us lunch .	that 's pretty normal . why would n't they ? that just seems impolite .
oh man , haha yeah i 'm experiencing time dilation because of this game !	you need to just get it , its well worth the money , i found monster hunter 3 ultimate just like tri but this game is a breath of fresh air
how is he holding that sign up ? his fingers do n't look like they are positioned right , and his other hand looks like it 's in his pocket .	i think he 's leaning it on his leg
a parmesan and dark chocolate grilled cheese . but it has to be the block parmesan not the kind you shake in your pizza . edit : apparently it 's s goddamn melt .	another great combo is cheddar cheese on apple pie !
if the model is still being paid to use her license then her job as a model has n't been automated , has it ?	it has if they keep using her likeness after she 's dead . thus keeping other models from taking her place .
i do n't care what lead wisconsin had , thats 5 points duke should not of gotten .	and okafor should n't have had 3 fouls in the 1st half . that severely impacted his game but it happened .
i thought exactly the same thing . i actually clicked through the article because of his picture headlining it .	what still blows my mind from time to time it 's there is people who are more flexible than eddie in the 10th planet system .
bloody deserves it too . i hope he has a wonderful close to his career over there , he 's been a champ for us .	he really has been great , i feel bad for doubting him during the first half of last season .
my mums a high end sanitation work helping developing in developing countries .	that is some fancy shit .
which belts ? air targets ? i have been using universal for the tracer round .	i use the air targets belt , yes i do n't have the tracer , but they do a lot of damage
do n't see the point in signing de jong tbh	i think we could do with a tough tackling dm . we do n't really have one in the entire squad . think i 'm right in saying his contract is about to expire as well , could be a good bargain .
for magic seals , i believe it 's almost always crit over main stat .	oh wow , really ? does the math just work out that way ? i 've been getting main stats this whole time .
no shit . she seems like a mentally handicap idiot .	yeah it was a pretty simple question .
the president is just one man who received intelligence on thousands of attacks . if the threat should have been labelled more credible , it was n't the presidents job to find that out .	it is however the president 's responsibility to ensure that the people who work for him respond .
it 'll be a sad day when you finally log in for the last time .	me too he 's like a smarter wizard fan than me and he 's not even a fan of the wizards
because obvs those cf folks do n't need time at home . she knows his job ! or is it just so she can post about being a military wife ?	how do you know someone is a military spouse or has kids ?
to be fair , glancing at your fm , you 're not anywhere near trip 's target audience .	that is a fair statement , and i agree . i prefer more energetic music , they were pretty boring to me .
i see a simple solution to this issue . do n't strangle your girlfriend and you 'll have no problems with the cops trying to get into your phone .	that 's works fine until you run into a cop that has it out for you .
he 's one of those people that until you 've seen him acting , you do n't know just how hot he is .	it 's so true . photos can only convey so much . the man is damn charismatic on screen .
i was just thinking of this movie today . it 's actually brilliant . if you have n't seen it , go watch it .	thats weird i was thinking of it too . i could n't remember what it was called , but wanted to re - watch it .
tbh i hate being alone on my birthday more .	i just do n't celebrate birthdays anymore .

i like it , but what if i said all of that in the text field of an image post of an image of two 600 pound people fucking ?	just post an amateur video of you and your so i think that 'll equate to around 800 or so pounds .
you do n't have to read the whole book , just the few chapters on atomic theory .	it 'd be more time efficient if you just communicate the main points to me in a few sentences . it 's too time consuming to find the right book , chapter , section , and paragraphs .

i do n't think it ended up selling at all .	no , i looked it did n't sell on ebay but who knows if it sold elsewhere . he is on holiday so i guess he will sell it when he gets back .
argos cat here , are we related ?	that 's a bit racist .
it does unless you define physics as something other than the things which happen in the universe .	no ? how on earth ?

i am honestly really curious as to what that sandwich is made of . it 's too colorful d :	it 's likely cream and fruit , it 's a desert thing .
then they fail to make a proper connection often . if i were a police officer i would not be comfortable using a taser to protect myself .	hence why a lot of people get shot instead of tazed . and it makes sense and is completely justifiable for cops to do that .
what was the reason ?	there 's no youtube description , no explanation given .
i was terrified of buttoned up shirts . so terrified in fact that i once tore my shirt off and ran out into the garden , tears streaming down my face .	it was the opposite for me , i always had my top button buttoned up until like 5th grade . i felt naked otherwise , i do n't know why . funny how now that 's come into style

the people who work on factory farms producing eggs are treated nearly as badly as agricultural workers harvesting produce .	good point , but what about this egg and this avocado ?
who will build our roads ?	well it 's a statist paradise so i imagine chain gangs of tax dodgers will build the roads .
mmmm , crave that carbonated sugar water .	really though , what does mountain dew taste like ? i do n't think i ever had any in my life . is it like sprite or an energy drink or something ?
i 'm going to temp take this down while i discuss with the other mods . thank you for understanding .	that 's cool . when i realized they just went up yesterday i thought it may be bogus . hope not though .
did you stripe the color on ?	no , i made the shrooms individually then attached them . the change in hue was due to the mini torch . i was trying to get the base of the mushroom to strike leaving the top green .

i forgot that the actors said some fucked - up shit was coming up . i 'm not sure that this was the moment , though . ramsay can always step up his game . the next episode could get worse .	i did n't think this was the hyped scene they were talking about . as the credits rolled i was wondering what horrifying stuff was still to come .
no . you do n't spike someone 's drink , especially if they never consented to it . fuck her , fuck you , fuck nixon and fuck glue . especially fuck glue .	yeah , stick it to the man !

the ones with money , who live in the us , you mean ?	in the us , you will still be found guilty , you just also have the option of buying yourself out of being punished .
i do n't support ted cruz and he 's utterly irrelevant to this conversation . all i 'm saying is that spending money to advertise a candidate is protected free speech in america .	sure , but not allowing corporations to spend billions . they 're not people too . we 'll be dumping that shit asap .
you are probably the reason that ebay listing has sold 100 of those things in the past hour .	this is my first time doing anything like that , focusing the internet on some poor sob that has to do work now .
close anything that creates an in game overlay or messes with driver settings and narrow it down . for example radeon pro instantly crashes it but i do n't know about others .	didnt work for me , any other ideas ?

it 's ridiculous how much space cars use in general .	public storage of private property .

he hits the ball first , not a foul .	til that if you hit the ball first with your left hand , you can hit a player in the face with your right hand and it 's not a foul
sanchez was back to being sanchez after two games . also , steve spurrier signed a few of his old qbs while with redskins . that does n't really mean anything .	chip kelly is n't correcting a tendency to press and throw ints in an older qb with one offseason . sanchez had great numbers in most of his games , even if he turned the ball over way too much .
they 're heavy . they 're kinda fragile . they 're not really exceptionally aero .	they are also super expensive once you consider everything you just said .
nice find , i did n't catch that when i went through either .	the link to the lords of war stuff is cool to see .

their families are n't british though . plus they 're a bunch of radical - muslim brainwashed fools .	their families are usually 2nd generation immigrants and frequently innocent and oblivious to what their children have gotten into . i 'd argue their families are more british than they are .

theres 2 versions of the album . the original one and the remix .	i know ; but none of them includes the song i have linked here .
it means he hopes to release it before season 6 , not necessarily that he 's planning on it . planning is too decisive a word for grrm .	the fact that he choose the same term to describe the amount of written and unwritten material makes me want to start crying .
you 're welcome , and i 'm sure there is a digital seller worth buying from ; i 'll do a quick scan and get back to you based on if i find anything .	appreciated . i did n't find anything in the quick search i did , but i 'm also not up on most of the digital sites .
that is your opinion . how 's work ?	are you going to start with that lame shit again ?

yup . pretty low barrier to play soccer , really . all you truly need is a ball .	that reminds me i need to get a damn ball in case my friends want to do a pickup game or something .
how was it ? did she know you were a virgin ? do you have any tips for moving house ?	it was alright . felt not as good as i imagined it would . no i did n't tell her . but after the fact my guess is she realized it . do n't move it .
did you use the game 's built - in save points ? if you did , then all you need to do is to load that save . if you did n't , then there is no way to restore your game .	yes i saved in game and that worked . it was n't until i tried to go to my last save point via gamepad that my save file disappeared
just tried this and could n't get it to happen . you might have to start the chapter over , see if you can progress then .	i just uninstalled it and am reinstalling it . that 's my last idea . is a chapter different from a level ?
it does , quite a lot more actually . it loses half of the airflow options because the ring is thinner and doesnt flip over , but the exchange for flavor makes it almost none .	dude you just hyped the fuck out of me , now i ca n't wait to get my hands on it hahaha
still waiting . pushed on the first day on my alt account just to see what it 'd do . now the wait for the yellow and red .	too bad there 's no way to track fake grays who simply press the button on alts . i personally have no alts . all or nothing .
i see absolutely no reason for that to be true , why do you think yes ? i could be missing something	it 's not think it 's fact . it 's just the way heat exchange works .
she probably got her first taste of delicious live meat playing crocodile : 9	if that was true , she 'd object to the idea of there being a crocodile than amethyst 's commitment to the role

stealing content usually gets exposed anyhow here and it is not like that this is an option one should chose .	so if youtube is not a problem for you , why should gfycat be a problem for you ?
with pvp being such a big part of this game , are they going to add in a way to reset your soul level ? it is there a way ?	that we know of there is currently no way to do that or respec for that matter , if you wanna reset , have to restart your character .
it does n't work . there 's always gonna be a little bit of shit caked on . and wiping it with dry paper does n't work very well .	wet wipes .
then why are n't bots legal ? what if i want to bot all my skills to 99 ? you should chill out and let people play how they want to play .	because buying a set of guthans and grinding 70 att and defense takes more effort than downloading a script and running it .
it 's not their responsibility as a company to monitor and look after people who use 3rd party services with their virtual items .	i ca n't believe people think it 's valves job to control gambling . why not have some self responsibility instead of blaming some one else for a change .
absolutely , that and assassination objectives . half the time they do n't even get on screen : d add that to the fact that you do n't need a clear line of sight either .	one thing that 's great about it , it 's pretty damn hard to team - kill with it .
awesome work , congratulations . seeing stuff like this makes me want to continue to work on my form . great job !	thank you ! btw , never stop working on the form .
just heard they take all your assets into consideration . they gave me all my money right away onto a debit card .	must be easy to convert it to cash or gift cards or something , and say you spent it ?
no shit , cunt .	shit cunt , what the fuck are you on about ?
it just seems like 5 wins before 3 losses would be quite the challenge , do n't you think ?	you can use the passage coins to buy modifiers to help you out . such as forgiving a single loss , counting one win as two , etc .
that goal keeper sure is dedicated , sorta blinded , bleeding leg and still trying to stop any oncoming goals .	he has spider strapping , probably has a quad injury that he has to prevent reoccurring . i initially assumed bleeding too
yay , super awesome toilet water ! will forever be blue !	until i turn it green .
brown i feel as though is optimal for me . loud enough and that perfect click for typing and gaming . i could possibly do blue and be happy .	yeah , i ca n't do blues . i like the prefer the sound and feel of the browns with a good deck and some nice double shot pbt 's .
luckily , we 're a small team , so i know everybody , and nobody is like , crazy obese . i think it 's a fairly even playing field .	you could just binge right before hand , and then a week before the final weigh in cut out all carbs .
it 's a national broadcast . this is a good thing .	agreed . the nhl wants to build off of last years playoff series and help foster a divisional rivalry by showcasing this game .
apparently not , as people are accessing the resources without accessing the ads . i also expect to be reimbursed for the stuff i do , it rarely happens . expectations can be wrong .	the resources required to serve up a video are expected to be paid for by ad revenue , when abp comes into play , that 's not the case . simple as that .
this is perfect , just what i was looking for . time to build myself and exp leeching , unkillable zdps monk : d	yeah you will be a lot tougher than standard zdps leech monk , but you will be leeching much less and you should n't be dying in standard speed runs anyway .
oh okay . you could turn the clock off though , just saying	still just not my game . i have tried , multiple times . i just can find hardly anything about the game i enjoy .
nope , tea is though .	same . not a coffee drinker .
do they have a warehouse full of bibles waiting for disasters to send these at a moments notice ?	probably why the bible is the top best selling book of all time . they do n't actually sell them to people , they sell them to churches and missionary groups to give away .
what would you say is your most controversial opinion ?	i think homosexuality is just so wrong .
starring two members of the bush does n't care about black people show !	his face was so priceless when kanye said that .
i ran a 4 : 15 mile on friday . so that 's pretty cool i guess	wow , great speed .
ive seen little plastic things shaped like this around is it related to cameras somehow ? or possibly tapes	it 's definitely related to records . i forget how - maybe it used to sit in the middle of them ?
i ca n't escape american sniper	that guy 's movie did n't win the oscar so now he 's haunting our tv shows .
i 'm not saying gs ca n't win tonight . i 'm saying let him get more rest and if you lose tonight it 's not the end of the world .	i do n't necessarily disagree with you , but i think it 's important for the team to have him back out there as well and see that he 's okay . worth the risk ? questionable
you can also just limit the scale of combat to match their team . might get rid of the fun buddy mechanic if npcs are following them around .	it depends on the players . mine love npcs to death and usually have companions anyways .
my god , you 'd think not a single one of you had ever seen a game called on account of rain before	but it 's not fair when we 're on the wrong end of it !
there is an armenian student association ? where is my half - finnish student association ?	bad move , college students are programmed to err on the side of extreme sensitivity .
nothing ? not even lucky underwear ? how boring .	not believing is silly things like luck and superstition is boring ? maybe you should pick up a science book .
thank you . cops need to know that no one likes them . they need to be fought at every step of the way . make their lives difficult . make them suffer .	well , i like cops , so there is at least one person who does .
in the description it says that it was probably a mix of fatigue and the weight of the camera equipment made him think he had his parachute .	it 's hard to feel sorry for a guy like that , i mean this is literally what evolution exists for .
i used to have a russian dwarf hamster . she definitely fit into the cute and round and weird description . haha well the daily and discussions are about all i intend to do here .	you should join in activities as well ! there 's definitely a bunch to do here . dwarf hams are the cutest ! then can have some big attitudes though hahaha
they 're our fucking neighbor , if this shit was happening in canada there would be outrage and the president would immediately make a public announcement giving our support . it 's sad really .	the thing is though that many mexicans do not want us involvement , i 'm sure that if they wanted help the united states would be there .
it does work . source my card fucking does it	sure , because your bank is nice . but they could change that policy at any time , and you would n't know .
oh , no . i was there . that was a really fun game .	that giants fan is simply a liar !
i just started to buzz it last year . makes it a lot easier to deal with , especially as a 20 year old guy	as a 21 year old guy , i find it simpler to just let it grow long and tie it up in the back .
people and animals hold different value .	perhaps - but does that justify the unnecessary killing of either ?
no ! do n't give into her demands . i do n't know your history but there 's no way in the world i would give someone else my kid 's newborn stuff .	the thing is that i 'd set it aside in a nice box to give to his dad for father 's day . now she expects it . sigh .
wasps pollinate some things , too . like figs . so i hope you do n't like figs .	do n't wasps die or lay eggs in figs ? can anyone confirm ?
do you start middle school this year ?	he must minecraft in between his call of duty sessions .
yeah , but he would look like the biggest douche ever to leave after the whole homecoming narrative	did n't stop him leaving the first time . if ya 'll shit on him enough he could leave again .
before i stick it in , do you reveal one of the danger vaginas and ask me if i want to switch my choice ?	but how would that even change your chances ?
they 've said pointing out rules helps on multiple occasions .	if you are going to point out the rules it helps to know what you are talking about first and not just posting about a rule whenever you do n't understand something
sunset shimmer is actually twilight 's biological mother . spoilers .	i have no idea who that is .
you take college acceptance tests at 11 ? does n't seem right	no , it 's high school acceptance tests , called sats .
skin off . skin on is going to give you a bitter flavor like you 've never had or wanted to have before . trust me . i 've done it before . also , remove the seeds .	that was a huge pain , and i feel like i wasted a lot of my fruit , but it 's done now . thanks for the advice .
lynx fans have had plenty to cheer about . not that i claim to be a lynx fan , or even a wolves fan . but everyone seems to forget about them .	who are the lynx ? a developmental hockey team ?
budgeting , not drinking too much when i go out , working hard . i need to get my shit straightened out .	if i am not dead i know i did n't drink too much .
for some newspaper editors , yes . i think they were n't in class when the teacher explained the numbers in school .	or maybe they 're working in a really funky metric space . i 'm not inclined to give them that much credit , though .
white boys always talking about your small penises . we get it , you are n't black , move along .	this coming from an asian .
they will be looking for meth soon and forget all about you . carry on bro , have a beer .	i 'll do just that , thanks for making me crack up a little haha

it was a joke , i know there are very different dialects of spanish , as i was berated until i got the pronunciation correct when i was in spain .	when the spanish kinda did the whole thing first . they 're kinda hipsters , just like the english about english .
it 'd be pretty epic to have us face off , imo	georgia and fsu were in talks for the 2016 game in orlando . obviously something happened on uga 's end since we 're playing ole miss instead .
i have n't seen the podium since i live in the states and nbc sucks	learn to understand , speak , or tolerate spanish . then turn to the spanish speaking channel . nbc sucks they know they suck but theyll keep doing this , because dat mad nascar money yo .
taking my combat boots off at the end of a long drill weekend .	mmm , i bet that 's orgasmic .
they should have no problem playing with an empty stadium , it will be just like playing at home for the white sox .	you are beating a dead horse .
i think i could live with 3 . any ideas ? i was looking at the acer aspire nitro . could i simply use a usb to dvi and hook up 3 monitors like that ? or get a usb hub ?	i 'm not sure if a usb port would work , if it does than a lot of laptop would work . going to have to look that up . but dedicated port goes most i seen is 3 on the higher end gaming laptops .
what about shaving a happy trail or whatever you want to call the line like patch of hair under the belly button ?	no . i can understand trimming if hair is too long and getting in the way , but i 'm the burly lumberjack kinda girl .
theres still time . we did n't trade back in until the last second last year .	you have to give up picks in exchange for other teams to give up theirs . we do n't have those picks to give up this year , and if we do , we will end up with fewer picks than we started with .
he 's right though , unity is really bad on linux .	ksp runs perfectly on linux , the fact that unity 's physics engine is single threaded is a bit annoying , but that isnt a linux specific issue .
i think everyone wants them , they ca n't host a game so the lower seed would host .	i hate this . we wo n't have any home games in our arena again until december .
fuck no . i am in a similar position like you .	well damn .
kanye is a horrible person , but i just have to agree that he is a musical genius	i dont get why youre being down voted just for stating your opinion .
and profession . it does n't matter what your last name is if you 're a truck driver .	yeah , profession along with education . being able to say you 're dr . ______ is more important than just being a _______ .
i 'm a state away and working on transferring the money .	why do n't you set up a bank account by a bank near you ?
i ca n't be the only one bothered by the fact that some letters use a bigger font than others	i had to read it 4 times because it was pissing me off .
i 've seen some of my friends talking back to their parents and it always shocked me . if i talked to my parents in a tone that hinted at any disrespect i 'd be screwed	from time to time , the tree of family must be watered with the blood of parents .
have you ever tried swing dancing ? lots of vintage addicts in that scene .	believe me , i want to ! i love dancing but i 'm definitely not too good at it . i love big band , swing , and jazz a lot too . used to play a bit myself .
uh , maybe i exaggerated a little . but it 's likely to be used as a justification to aid dawn with arms and airstrikes against jihadist targets , polarizing the two camps further .	right right ! odd dynamic between all of them .
how could anyone in the u . s . not know what tomorrow is ? it 's one of the biggest ad revenue generating fake holidays we have .	actually i 'm in australia but thanks for the fact i guess ?

why dont cars have carbon monoxide detectors that shut off the car ?	how would that stop them from simply disabling it ? if someone is determined to kill themselves good luck stopping them without them asking for help .
that is my favorite role as well , i have the dvd somewhere love watching that .	i just re - watched it for the first time in a while . still an incredibly emotionally impactful film .
no wonder women 's sports are n't respected as much as mens . this is a joke and an insult to what these women are probably actually capable of .	you 're super right and yet i love them anyway . stupid confusing world .
i fucked your mother !	dad !
these are the things that make me feel like there are 10 people working in the entire art department of a billion dollar company .	oh man arent you just the coolest assholes on the block .
this makes me so sad . no one deserves to be treated like this . edit : they have a state religion ! i have no idea how anyone can support them .	lots of countries have a state religion . in my country the head of state is the head of the state church and bishops sit in the upper house . i live in england .

i 'm so glad you mentioned this . i 've always loved tremors , but could n't explain why i found it so entertaining and enjoyable to watch . now it makes sense .	that wall of guns is reason enough to love that film .
yep . throw a smoke in a doorway , shoot at the doorway , mow down 5 enemies who try to walk through the smoke .	or pick a proper gun and do it faster , more accurately and more efficiently .
fuck yeah , this guy gets it . those movies have some of the best soundtracks . eye of the tiger is my favorite song ever , always gets me motivated . rocky is awesome .	my roommate and i freshman year of college would play eye of the tiger to get us in the mood to start drinking . it always worked .
watching a bit of nv 's stream . i never realized how good of an in game director loony is . he 's actually pretty smart .	yeah , i 've been surprised that he 's basically been the vocal leader since they formed , along with being super talented .
yeah they were n't too great in rome . we have n't lost to ireland in a long time and if it turns into a dog fight we should have the advantage	nah they 've been playing in a whole different tier . a southern hemisphere level . they probably would have beaten the all blacks last year the way they were playing .
phone : 42 laptop : 23 i think display plays a large role .	yeah especially size . when everything is smaller you can see everything closer together so i guess you could detect it faster .
why would you film a monitor ?	maybe there 's some sort of protection on the computer containing the footage and you do n't want to be copying to and from it ?
i thought people were claiming people , not countries . like , nobody is england , somebody could be the king or prime minister , somebody could be field marshal etc ?	in that case people should be able to play as members of a colonial government .
oh yeah . oops . does n't the retired pope still live there though ?	thought they stayed pope until death ?
i assume op has a battle net login but has never played wow . in that case , why would they hack his account instead of creating their own .	use his credit card to create a dummy account that will either bot , hold gold , scam or spam .
catalonia is still spain . sorry to burst your bubble	you ca n't change the feelings of the people . welcome to the real world : p
he 's lucky . i took a shot off the throat like that and it broke my adam 's apple in two .	my throat hurts in sympathy . hope the recovery was quick and complete .
why do you call it unskilled labor ? it 's not assembly line work , it 's driving a huge bus , which apparently takes some skill .	because you do n't need a degree and they train you on the job . it 's not to say what they do is n't difficult , just that anybody could be hired to do it .
a slinky , we had like 5 stairs in our house .	that 's a lot of stairs . you guys must have had a lot of fun !
the draft position was not meant to say he was automatically great . it means that he was expected to be great from the beginning .	it still has no effect on his career or legacy . put trent richardson behind walter jones and steve hutchinson and i can guarantee you he would n't be considered a bust .
man i miss the days weed did n't give me anxiety	man i wish being high did n't trigger my motion sickness
the ironic part is people post all the time about how they did n't have some problem before and now after they 've stopped all these issues are popping up and they have no idea what 's wrong .	examples ? i 've been subscribed for years and have no idea what you 're talking about . sounds like you 're making shit up .

a fellow brother of the flame ! i wish him well in his holy crusade !	i do too , that glorious fiery bastard made everyone 's day a lot brighter

if i press , the button 's timer resets . by definition it will extend the time of the button . this is why i stay pure . you and your filthy presser logic makes me sick .	who said we want the button to end ? as a gray , i have already attained that which i most desire : to remain pure and gray .
hockey players hugging each other while their teammates are beating the crap out of each other rock the most !	from what i 've read when that was posted before they have to stop the opposing team from getting involved in a fair fight . they just decided to hug it out rather than watch each other .

we had like 30 penalties from rub plays this season . it was ridiculous . never saw one called against an opponent .	man that sounds terrible . i am sure everyone feels really bad for you too .

how many kids does your friend have ?	she has 4 young kids . this was done for her 2 year old 's b - day party .

yes it 's two 1 oz bottles per pack . we feel confident it 's enough to get a good taste for the sauce .	awesome ! you guys rock !
usually a dude .	depends on the dude . i mean , let 's be honest , if it 's a 25 year old bodybuilder , the price is gonna be a lot lower than it would for some old guy .
honestly it 's for the best in some cases . room and board is usually more expensive , but at least you do n't have a mortgage to worry about .	my friend in another fraternity nationals own almost every house either them or an alumni trust . the latter is even better becuase if shit goes down you just take the letters off the front .

it makes all that much more sense in wrestling . all he 's doing is playing the heel and saying he 's great . clearly effectively since he has your panties in a bunch	just like all those times he called himself the best wrestler when he was n't a heel ? you 're delusional if you think phil brooks is n't the biggest narcissist to go through wwe .
i 'll definitely be sitting in on this lecture . i suspect this is due to his son attending queens .	its very common for campus conservative groups to bring in ministers . they brought in several at my school .
he 's been coasting a bit on offense since all star break . he 'll hit his stride back at home after he gets some ass from his girl . not worried	that girl 's got a lot of ass to give

it only works if someone reports it . unlikely on a back country road .	yeah in my city i 'm pretty sure i was the only one that had it , so it was useless for stuff like that

this game is the only thing standing between me and months of mariota rumors by the philly press .	you guys better pray that you get mariota . that kid is the real deal , and chip wants him , bad .
gsw in 5 . suns would pull out one . it would fucking suck , but playoffs is absolutely better than no playoffs . so long as i do n't need to listen to these announcers .	yes , taking 1 or 2 games in the west playoffs is a massive improvement over last year so that would be not a failed season
i believe both round 1 picks will be defense .	i do n't think both pick necessarily have to be defense , but no way will both picks be offense .

do you disagree that new cars need to be detailed ? or that the cleanup process for their brand new cars is not detailing ?	there 's just not that much to do to make a new car really shine . to me , seeing an older car with faded paint look new again is much more enjoyable .
that p in photographic is only an f sound when paired with the following h . i see no h in jpeg .	the g in graphic is only hard when not followed by an i or an e . i see an i in gif . i pronounce it gif , but that 's a bad argument .
well that would hurt as bad as when we traded revis !	probably worse tbh , revis was coming off injury so it half made sense . this would just be devastating
so cool ! jealous !	awww yeah ! i just gotta remember to being the cup to work tomorrow ! : d
the man in me , but both are great songs	oh my bad . but yeah , great . and i love the big lebowski too . shame

rockstar does fail to effectively communicate with their community , but you have to admit , even if rockstar as a company pisses us off sometimes , they make some great fucking games .	and the dlcs are free as much as they fuck up i appreciate that .

they need to come up with a super speedway rear bumper that makes pushing impossible .	like the cup cars .

this is just more untrue propaganda created by men to further demonize women .	agreed . he would n't be jailed if he had done nothing wrong .
i prefer english over my language . french sucks .	you can say that again . how do you decide which third of the letters in a word to pronounce ?
well that was out of nowhere also could n't people recreate the paid levels in the lever studio ?	i think you have to buy the paid levels to even get the level studio , according to the na trailer .
i picked it up in 2012 . not that old , but out of warranty period for sure .	that 's scary . i bought mine new last year . did you find a solution to the problem with yours ?
i have just started so i 'm really bad .	i let boyd die early . i would try to keep him , rolf , and oscar so you can do the triangle attack .

ha , saw the video on facebook .	haha ! yep . small social media world . buddy of mine posted it last night ! it took is about 15 minutes to do it because he kept waking up .
with the rb respawn point system ? nope .	fair enough so that 's the issue then .
what is so good about having carriers anyway ? one airstrike or missile from the enemy and it 's gone .	point defense systems are a thing , you know . and in the meantime , a carrier can deploy planes all over the world pretty quickly .

yamato of mym i think ? boy his voice is so sex .	he was actually casting lcs in swedish a while back on a big tv - channels website , it was really cool !
god . this is one of the main reasons i am so against having kids myself . i 've already got a quick temper . i ca n't take that risk .	good for you . it should be viewed as a responsibility people choose to take on , like charity work . not some checkbox for everyone 's life .

absolutely , but i 'm just pointing out that not everyone who is n't a healthy weight becomes obese .	they should probably make a choice at some point then . skinny people clothes are too tight on them and fat clothes look like wearing a tarp .

it 's a stereotype , but that does n't make it racist .	so saying criminals are usually black is a stereotype not racism ? at what point does it become racism ? what 's the cutoff ?

we 're closing on our house today at 1pm cst !	woohoo ! such a long process finally coming to an end ! congratulations .
i do n't even really care if we get it , it 's not like i can afford tickets anyway . australia put in a bid , give it to them , just no one that 's using slave labor .	and a place where it actually makes sense to hold it when the world cup should be held .

not bad , what colour tip ?	hm so u interested ? like u want me to add u ?
are you excited for it . do you want to watch it . if so , why ?	yes . yes . because of the cast , the premise , the writers and because i usually like ryan murphy 's shows .
haha i feel you . i been like that for a while but just started again since last year . hopefully for good this time .	nice ! i 'll be looking out for your work .
i say jagex monitors them or somehow regulates gambling . i 'm saying this as a csgo gambler who saw the massive benefits to csgo once gambling was embraced .	why would jagex even spit in these guys direction ? they are doing games of chance and have been banned on several accounts . please tell me you 're trolling or have no idea who these goons are .
i have no issues with eli and find him quite likable , but archie seems to have an inflated view of his time in the nfl , and i already listed my issues with peyton .	i 'm pretty indifferent towards peyton but i do like eli . i 'd love him if not for the draft shit .
the suns do n't match the shadow direction .	and this proves that she did not land on the moon !
gandhi owns nukes though .	dude , fuck ghandi .

i am trying to figure out what is in some of the containers . mashed potatoes , green beans .	looks like those mashed potatoes are rice . definitely sweet potatoes , though .
i dont agree with the punishments in the justice system . the kind of person who rapes is the kind that should be dead	saying that kind of thing makes you no better than someone who would murder .
would you rather it be broken like all the other games or wait a month and get a smooth running game ?	see , i 've made that point multiple times in the past , but after two pc delays and countless heist delays i 'm done making excuses for them .
when white cops started murdering young black men in large numbers .	the fact is , a police officer murdered and framed a man , color should n't be important
hi drew , when doing research , you should be searching for data , not charts . then make charts to communicate the interesting data !	i agree . though , getting the data is proving surprisingly difficult to find .

i assumed so , we were thinking he may want to go ahead and use the money he saved up for a 1440p display instead of the 1080 . if he does would you expect there to be a noticeable drop in fps ?	should still be fine for world of tanks . but if he wants to play anything more graphically intensive at very high settings , a gpu upgrade might be in order .
same with chelsea . the first half of that game we looked like a much better team than they did	totally agree . i think the possession based game we play allows us to compete with anyone , while looking wholly awful . i do n't see why we ca n't win against city or chelsea .
they just changed the law in california to eliminate the personal belief exception . the only exception is now based on religious grounds or due to adverse medical reactions .	but religion is a personal belief .
drive . 2011 . ryan gosling , bryan cranston , oscar isaac , among other names . beautiful movie , very overlooked . i ca n't even reveal much of the plot . check it out . cheers .	that is one of my most taste favorite movies . not a lot of wasted dial a log for slow people .

the acting is fun to watch , and it the dialogue was hilarious and fun . that 's part of the appeal to me .	and i loved all the actors . really liked the movie .
or they could tell data to hide until the future when he can tell starfleet .	now where would you get a crazy idea like that ?

you know whats retarded , someone near and dear to me is a police officer and they would have never done anything like this .	enforced the law ?
i 've never used a number pad on any keyboard in my entire life . the buttons on top are much nicer .	you do n't speak for everyone . pro users like audio and video editors need a num pad for base functionality .
