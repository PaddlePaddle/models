thanks m8 , and i was thinking you did a better job of the buildings and rubble in the distance .	i remember that being a tough part to do . i also used ur version as my wallpaper like the other member
pictures are in reverse order for some reason .	i read it backwards and forwards and it did n't make sense either way .
yeah i 'd say they are a bit . but blunts have more street - cred .	the entire culture that surrounds weed fucks shit up like this . it 's smoking pot , not a drive - by .
i hated under the skin until a guy here took a lot of time to explain it . i can at least say i appreciate it now .	i feel the same way about lucy .
so , who 's going be voting for who ?	lib dems , it 's either them or snp in my constituency , so no choice there .
i kinda miss cloud and sunset posts .	i 'd post a sunset , but it 's currently blowing snow sideways so that 's probably not too appealing .
i was thinking ron 's new company was a perfect setup	totally agree !
it would essentially be the same setup as sports in the us . no stopping the degradation of the lower levels , but a lot more money for the top levels .	but where 's the fun of the relegation scraps and where 's the motivation for players in the championship ? surely they 'll have no commitment to the side and little or no loyalty ?
tie her to the fence on the freeway pedestrian overpass and fuck her from behind during the rush hour commute . you 'll have about 15 minutes before the police arrive , so make it quick .	they 'd be gone in 60 seconds . giggity .

how much did do that cost ?	i was n't the one paying for this trip , so i 'm not sure . sometimes breakfast is included with staying at the hostel , also .
ohh , okay . is it like an art thing ?	stuff with photoshop , it is really cool .
that would make 1 game worth buying . not buying a console for 1 exclusive and a rehash of a game i 've already bought twice and played to death	the ps4 should be around for another 5 years or so . lots of good games should come our during that time .
you 're lucky they cancel your classes . we could be buried under snow but we 'll still have class no matter what .	same here . pitt gives 0 fucks about the snow or cold .
very surreal photo . when i make a band , this will be our album cover .	be sure to include the dog and the guy pointing . they are what really makes it work .
he has cited his university - level education . you 're just stating scenarios that you thought might maybe happen .	su after czechoslovakia had very good relationships with big number of countries . that is a fact .
plenty of alternate sources in english . even the bbc has passed on the current count whenever relevant to a news item .	give one example of a respectable western article in english which focuses on this new information . there are a couple of articles that mention it in passing . not on bbc though .
we are 4 and 0 when i gave up tickets this year , am i no longer allowed to attend games ?	take one for the team ! a win is a win !
that 's actually how i explain it to my friends .	hahaha same . as soon as i say this , they understand xd
one of the best ships in star trek imo .	its fleet version is one of the best ships in sto .
i think bc is going to end up the real victim here . where is he going to get another job ? the wwe wo n't hire him , that 's for sure , he 's too old .	is n't he going on tour with marilyn manson soon ? he 'll be fine . there 's always money in rehashing the 90 's with a bunch of hired guns instead of your original band mates .

i would say jessica jones season 2 is the last season before the defenders .	im assuming we are still getting defenders as the first series in 2017 , so next year we will get luke cage , iron fist and season 2 of daredevil
you guys see anything concerning in the photo ? i 'm not saying there is , just wondering if i should give anything a closer inspection . edit , 160k miles .	a valve clearance check .
iron man two when she 's fighting happy as well	i never saw that film . why would someone want to hit happy d :
gangs did n't break that young man 's neck .	the guy was a gang member and a criminal . it was bound to happen eventually . stop siding with the criminals and get on the police 's side
freedom for her to find someone nice ?	nah , him having to clean his own house , cook his own meals , and deal with whatever issues the children still need to call home about would be senseless .
now i might belong in this subreddit for this question but would n't it be better for ww to go red or golems to start ? thats how i do it at least .	might be because ww wants to get the smite on red for health . but then he 'd start gromp , not blue .
damn lucky toy ! bet it does n't appreciate it !	haha well it has served me well but it has gone to the big toy recycling center in the sky . after years with my faithful , it is no more .

i just hope they make some more room on the thing since i still have n't hit lvl 4 on my hunter for eris yet . then again she is gunna be pretty worthless after how hits .	i hope how does n't nerf eris too much . i still want to get more ranks on her and would like for those to actually give me some benefit .
what sort of drm will be used ? will gta5 on pc be steam exclusive ? it will be really disappointing to see yet another company jumping in to prop up valve 's growing monopoly .	afaik there are 2 versions : the steam one , and the rockstar club one .
side note . why is it that i can feel more drunk from 4 bud lights than i do with 3 heavy whiskey and cokes ?	how quickly did you drink both of those ? i 'd guess that you drank the beer a bit quicker , yeah ?
do you have any formula experience in excel ? because all of the backend work was actually not done by me and would have no idea how to implement that .	yeah had to do a fair bit for my data management class , i 'll try and see if i can do it on my own quickly .
out of curiosity , how likely would it be for a driver to lose control at highway speeds if they were to run over a duck ?	do n't know why you got down voted . it 's a real concern for the safety of others and a real physics problem . the answer is not likely at all .
when in stressful situations , i tend to do the thing that will get me out of it the fastest , with no regard for future consequences . makes me fucking terrified of being an adult .	do you lie ? like with no regard to what actually happened , even if telling the truth is beneficial in the long run ?
i still do n't see why people smurf . you have an account already , fucking play it .	but my false sense of superiority will be lost if i try a new champion and lose a few games ! i need to stomp lower ranking players to inflate my delicate ego .

quill . not pen . pens already have ink .	so it would be stupid to dip them in ink .
good idea . carriers have absolutely zero incentive to update devices at the moment .	with apple you just buy new , same with android . sadly ms phone is such a small part of the market . maybe this will help change that .
why the fuck matt has a lamp turned on in his apartment !	so people will suspect someone is home and no one will break in , just a guess .
talking on the phone when you are in a checkout line - completely ignoring the person who is ringing you up	and letting the rest of us in on your personal life as if we wanted to hear any of that .
when did the guys forget how to play hockey ? i come home from work excited to watch the hawks play and i get treated to this garbage . i do n't understand this team as of late .	they are apathetic as fuck . its so goddamn frustrating watching a team with this much talent flounder like this .
unfortunately for greece , the bit of byzantine culture that survived was plotting and backstabbing . such is life on the balkans .	that was the important part ! survival skills .
i had no idea who roger goodell was until i googled him , so i 'll just hate bettman more .	bettman never thought two weeks was adequate suspension for a player punching out his wife in an elevator .
yeah i do n't know , she makes me kind of uneasy . she just seems to say the right things , just enough to keep the group on her side . it kind of comes off as an act .	she 's like a mix of that terminus woman and the governor . two types of creepy .
check out screen kings , they have a variety of shirts and styles and very high quality printing .	screen kings is great , the owner is also a talented graphic designer and has a lot of quality examples to showcase his work and experience .

begone vile scum . your kind holds sway here no longer	what action can you do ? you are living in the past when your choice made 1s of difference . that time is gone you have no more say in this matter .
all - natural soda .	does naturally carbonated water and fruit juice count ?
because their school name is n't oklahoma university , it 's the university of oklahoma .	i just thought it was strange that clay travis , a famous football blogger , would call them uo .
me too , i ca n't wait to spend a couple months there next year . lovely country but there seems to be a ridiculous amount of patriotic shitposters here .	i get the feeling the ones from here who would be willing to meet you are n't the same ones posting the patriotic shite .
please do n't call the glorious pc battlestation platform a console .	i 'd leave pc out of the question because that camp would pop up anyway .
he bit a hooker 's tongue off at some point .	no no , the hooker bit his tongue off , that 's why he had to stop being a pitch man and became a filmmaker .
so women 's wrestling only counts if they are all ugly and coveted in burlap	you ca n't pretend the goal of a women 's episode of tna is anything but to get guys to watch pretty girls . do n't pretend it 's because of the work rate . it 's disingenuous and stupid .

nice try . keep up the good work !	lol . most passive aggressive post ever

you dont even have to fucking exercise to lose weight . just eat less or healthy . i honestly dont get why its so hard .	you do n't even have to eat healthy ffs . 40 pounds down so far on a diet of junk food snacks and boxed dinners . just count calories and you 're good .
simple , one line suggestions could just be posts with the suggestion completely in the title .	if people do n't wish to use this , that 's entirely fine . just treat it as a normal suggestion post .
i would love that , but considering how long it took for train , i 'm guessing we 'll at least have to wait for the operation after this one .	well , they probably starting working on it a while before katowice since it seemed like they had it planned out by then , so hopefully it does n't take as long .
they 're never going to do that . also fta when it comes to this country a lot of said obesity is caused by the sugar in alcohol . that 's why it 's called a beer gut .	no sugar in beer mate , you body simply prefers to burn the alcohol over anything else - meaning when you drink loads , more carbs get stored instead of burnt .
im an idiot . based on your title i thought you meant this was yours and you shared it with an animal . i spent too long trying to find the animal .	i thought the rock on the left hand side was a snapping turtle .
is there any chance of summoning ever happening in osrs ? i do n't know how others feel about it , but i thought it was one of the most creative skills with a lot of potential .	summoning is a huge big no , pretty much no one wants it

that 's actually not very high , i 'm def at 130 , 140	that would have been fucking restarted if we lost , holy shit .

it is a shame . does he have son who can fulfill the prophecy ?	you mean the anti - christ ? i think he goes by the name corey perry these days .
we 're talking this season .	sure you were ! because his dutch nickname developed because of his half year at man united , that 's why you were referencing it .
just remember the loyalty only works when you transfer that character from 360 over . so shift account swapping does nothing .	so i would have to load up bl2 on my 360 and upload my character to a cloud save for this to work ?

to apply ? wow , did n't know that .	how else do you think they got money ?

why is this being posted ? it has literally nothing to do with body acceptance . seriously , op is a regular contributor at fatpeoplehate . can we not ?	while i thought the article itself was a really cool and interesting read , the context of this post is thinly - veiled trolling . too bad , i would 've upvoted .

dead throne is n't really an album that i got into , but if you 're trying to convince me that it 's really good , which songs should i listen to ?	i 'm not really trying to convince anyone but mammoth and vengeance are really great imo
you could also save two points with calculation , which would only flip 1 focus , and would still need an action .	calculation allows you to spend a focus token to turn a hit to a crit . you 'd only get to use it for one attack .
ok , absolutely , one of the coolest moments in sports fandom i 've ever seen .	it kind of reminds me of the guy that snuck a shark into a sharks game , and then came back years later with an even bigger one .
this is n't fatlogic . no one really believes this it 's just goofy unfunny shit your grandmother posts on facebook .	ugh , i was about to say , this is the sort of thing your grandma thinks is clever and hilarious .

please let it just be canon that he has been taught proper english . noticeable dutch accents just hurt my ears .	yeah , most dutch people speaking english have an awful accent . luckily that 's more with older people than with younger people .
i want to see him live so i can have an opinion about his live performances .	i 'd call it good if it was any better than the last time i saw him granted that was a couple of years ago but still it would be a success in my eyes
3 in 1 bbq , bike stand , clothes rack .	i 've only seen the bbq thing once . it was hilarious . tin foil all over the bottom of the basket , and then a puzzled look when the charcoal would just push through the bottom .
he is impossible to miss unless you disable it before you start a new game .	maybe it detected a nothing save somewhere on my hard drive then ! cheers !
well the lady said 'we had n't considered anyone in a long time 'and the kid carl met said 'this girl got here a couple months ago 'so fishy . edit : paraphrasing the quotes .	nice , i did n't even catch that , that is sort of suspicious .
i will subscribe to any official service that puts up the subs within a week of air date .	crunchy roll will be on that like white on rice .

a kid was shot for theft ? what the fuck	woah there , do n't be so quick to blame the cops . i see this too often where people hear what they want to hear to justify their distaste for the law .
in many cases , campus police are actual police . they are n't rent - a - cops , they are n't security guards .	i know uconn is so big that they hav their own police department , filled with real police officers .
finances . i do n't know anything . from paying medical bills to filing taxes .	definitely a class should be mandatory in high school . learn all about finances , and credit . but then credit cards would be it if business .

well , at least the snake did n't it her kids	i hope it eats his kids as anyone genetically related to him is human pos , apple does n't fall far from the tree . best that his genes go extinct .
canadian here . that seems like a really low salary for an extremely important job .	american here . it is a really low salary even if it were not an important job . i made more when i was waiting tables part time at a red lobster . gtfo of there op , that 's some bullshit .
not just a helmet , but a full helmet .	great point . most injuries to the head in motorcycle accidents are to the chin and face .
they keep saying execution style . to my knowledge that involves a barrel to the head while on your knees . pretty sure that does n't apply here .	people also tell me that he was an innocent little boy , ignoring the fact that he was actually a thug who had just robbed a convenience store .

holy china , that 's wild man . i would love to visit some day and ride a motorcycle across the county .	come teach english . its stupid easy and if you know what you are doing you can make good money .
they are a pleasure to shoot , and make the ping ! happen all on your own , haha . they are truly awesome .	my guilty pleasure is inserting an empty en bloc and working the action just to hear that sound .

what about humans though , lots of time and money training them and quite a few criminals do n't get nearly as harsh of a penalty for killing them .	so then you 're making an argument for more prison time for the murder of human beings , not less time for the murder of police dogs .
color ? price ?	black brand new . large and small wristbands . 70 shipped ?
and how will you feel when price comes back down to earth the l column starts to pile up ?	if it happens we will change the way we a the game entirely . you play differently when your goalie is weak because you need to score at of goals
that 's not the point , but glad this post caught your attention .	we read every post , but what exactly is your point ? you are asking to redo it , because it is creepy , but the reasons you state are basically about what larvesta is .
first of all that 's a good mom . she makes her kids think . but older brother is going to hard life .	agreed . i feel like the little brother got a bit of a raw deal having to sneak around his brother . older bro is a stick in the mud , controlling little guy . i hope things are better now .
one screen with hdmi cable , one with dvi - hdmi	will there be any visual differences between the two ?
psych . first four seasons were amazing . after that , went downhill for me , aside from a few gem episodes in the 6th season .	that show had arguably the worst series finale of any show in television history .
probably . it 's always shown up roughly a week before the season premiere in the past .	that is what i thought happened with the walking dead as well , this makes me happy !
i definitely see what you mean . i guess the destruction just represents how active they were in them . luckily for me my pair has no chance of ending up like that .	same with me , unless i can land a job where my ass is n't glued to a desk or somewhere i can bike to work my wdc pairs are gonna depend heavily how much of a weekend warrior i can be
it 's weird how the price has been mostly dropping for like 63 weeks now and yet every bit of advice on how to make profit is to just wait even more .	have you even seen the price trend over the last month ?
this is a throw away - im 27 and i keep a small trash can in my closet that i pee in during the night time to avoid going to the bathroom . and im a female	how much farther away is your bathroom compared to your closet ? i hope if you 're living in a dorm that you have a room to yourself !
if you intend to keep your customers happy , you 'll patch your games for free . as has always been the case .	when you 're getting shit for free , you 're not a customer . customers pay for shit .
this is why we have boxing gloves . they are not designed to protect the person being hit . they are designed to let the person hitting hit harder without breaking the bones in his hands .	are n't they just safer to get hit with though ? i mean , an actual punch would have a bit of a terrible wound depending on where it hit with the knuckles .
i do n't see why you would n't hold a blade on each side with a thumb on one and fingers on the other .	then move the handle sliding the device between the two blades . this may be how consistent pressure on the blades is maintained . then flip each blade over , and sharpen the other side .
if he did n't have adamantium coating his skull would wolverine 's healing factor be enough to counteract a headshot ? what about a single bullet vs . a shotgun blast ?	going by deadpool , who 's healing factor is derived from wolverine 's , yes he would have been able to survive the rifle shots .
no , fsm is an argument , not a god . it was invented by atheists , what does that tell you ?	if fsm was real it would be a god .
jail , most likely .	na probably his room , for about ten minutes or so .
the president gets a pension though . pretty sure some baseball player that no one ever heard of wo n't make much after he is done playing baseball .	like baseball players who earn tens of millions at the very minimum in the course of their career need a pension .
i play destiny and when i can , frozen synapse .	unfortunately i do n't play either of them , but frozen synapse looks cool as fuck .
while i agree , and do n't support ukip , nigel does support drug reform and believes the war on drugs is a failure	yeah , cameron had similar views too before he got into high office . i wo n't get excited until someone who actually gets into power comes out in favour of reform .
there are 1000 other teams you could watch . not sure why you watch chelsea if you do n't like . i mean i 'm not sure why one team out of thousands playing like this should affect you .	because i 'm from london , not too many premier league teams in london who have champions league quality but chose to play like pricks
well , they do often say the truth is an ugly business and he seems to be dealing in a lot of that , so i guess i can understand that .	he also drove a studio into the ground and had to give his employees safe words because he was such a horrible person .
it does n't seem to press me as such	i find it pleasing . it 's not perfect , but it 's not button tear , ether .
oops , meant trading post .	and how does that help double up on gold ? sorry i just started playing again very recently after a year off .
i hear some rendition of this reply on a daily basis . i 'm actually a pretty happy dude ! also , yes , i 'm a fucking blast at parties .	nono , the other guy
or maybe , just maybe , if you want a snack , just munch on one oreo cookie . no you fat slob , not 1 family pack , 1 piece .	hard candy is good too , you can suck on it for a long time , so the one you can eat lasts longer .
yea the thing is , as long as toplane isnt an irelia only lane no meta is for wickd , obviously he either cant or wont perfect any other champion	two years ago he was considered best top for europe and he was head - to - head with soaz . he was playing much better at the aggressive meta
fucking disgrace considering the outing niese had and that our offense showed up .	damn , you are easily the most negative person on this sub rn . take it easy .
the killing joke .	murder value 3 .
yeah micro center has the bottles and cans . never tried the cans , but they have all the bottled flavors . just tried the orange one which i did n't even know they made and it was delicious .	the cans kind of lose their special feel to them , so it 's just like drinking any other sugar water at that point .
yea , seriously . these sjw 's lack the warmth and depth to be called a pussy	so they 're more like a cold hard cock ?
we 're switching to kronos in a month or two . i 've messed with the demo in the app and it 's not impressive .	we 've been using it for a year or two now and it sucks . our old system was archaic but it was super functional . kronos looks nice but my god is it a pain in the ass to use .
whats wrong with winter ? the awd tesla is a monster in snow .	the cold and batteries do n't get along . i can attest from first hand experience .
espn always has good hockey ads pumping the sport , which makes little sense as they seem to hate the sport given how they treat it .	no kidding . i 'm very happy with being able to see every playoff game . now , if we could just get rid of pierre mcguire
may i ask which bible verse , and why ? not judging , just think it 's an interesting thing to put on a business card .	for how techs , this might just push them over the edge if the person is holding two business cards .
i do n't see that in the video you linked . or the half hour of speed runs i watched after because of the video you linked . my god , i forgot how entertaining speed runs were	he 's writing the code using the game . the weird things he 's doing , the spacing , everything . that 's how he 's editing the memory .
well it was an exaggeration sure , but my point is i do n't see them going from a superbowl win to last in the division .	if it happens , it 'll be because their secondary evaporated and brady actually served a four game suspension and that throws the team off .
did n't scottie stay one more year ?	he came back later was gone with the rest of them that off season .
nwo was out to destroy wcw though and hated sting . just found it funny . bray couldve looked a bit stronger even if i was pulling for taker	well they hated sting in 98 . sting was in the nwo by the end of that year . and an enemy of an enemy is a friend , so nwo would rather stand up for sting to preserve their own legacy .
and how did that work out for the 360 players ?	lol it 's part of the reason the game died .
and still win nothing - sad	really ? bucs fan gonna talk shit ?
saxton sounds fine now , this is his role . no one can commentate by themselves	joey styles would like a word with you .
i like red coffee ; brewed with the blood of my enemies	i like blue coffee : made with the tears of my enemies !
this sucks because i wanted new orleans in the playoffs . too bad .	yeah , all year i 've been rooting for the whole sw to make it in . but my desire for that 2 seed is greater .
where is lady stoneheart ? i 'm just flat out done with the show .	i do n't think they are doing that part . also , the hound is most likely really dead .

trying to figure out where it is exactly . king road ? edit : ca n't tell if that 's a farm field or not . i 'm tired .	this is just off rattle run road . not a farm , but there happens to be one right behind those trees !
yea , 30 mins is too long . different wall designs is something new to see in videos though .	yep i love the idea , but try to get it down to 12 minutes or so . with some editing this could be a jam packed video with lots of info in a little amount of time .
i 'm gonna start throwing punches . fucking blues fan walking up giving me shit about tonight and crows center ice mess up the other night . jackass .	high road my friend . blues do n't have a cup .
why have you got those cables running through the middle of the room ? i was waiting for the cat to run through them and break something .	it 's temporary . my gf just moved the stereo to that side of the room but she has to buy some longer cables .
russel brand , he 's a cocky pompous asshole and really not that funny at all .	aye , just because you can make a few people laugh it does n't mean your opinion is worth pigeon shit in a delicate political debate .
post history says they are texan . colour me surprised .	i really hate texas . like , with a passion .
you could also try not buying gems and just play the freaking game the way it 's supposed to be played . it 's no fun when you pay to win .	what exactly bugs you about an individual spending their money how they want ?
what 's a dirt cake ?	the actual dessert is usually oreo crumbs chocolate pudding and gummi worms . so its like you 're eating dirt with worms in it .
the step where he was given the basic human right to a trial ?	has anyone on the losing side of a war been charged with war crimes and found not guilty ? i always thought those trials were kangaroo courts .
actually , islam .	you ca n't make a blanket statement about an entire religion . it just is n't true .

i 'd let the world know of my power , and also inform them i 'm accepting donations to keep yourself alive . i 'd kill the biggest donors .	that 's funny . i was thinking of eliminating the useless impoverished groups that just exist .
many developers , including google android devs themselves must be wrong then , that sd - cards have shitty performance and that they cause issues	i can record 4k to my sd card without problems .

not since he was another human that i do n't want to wish devastating injury upon .	that too . i would n't wish it on him in miami , but i would n't care that much either . lbj is the man for going back home though imo . cleveland needs a hero .

i actually think protein powders are a great way to save money . i get mine from costco and use it to replace breakfast and it comes out to something like 90 cents a meal .	food is way better . and if your are trying to build strength and mass you do n't wanna be replacing a meal with a shake you still wanna eat and then in between meals drink shakes .

as someone who ca n't see 3d , what sold me was that the c - stick works as a cpp , and the extremely sexy mh4u le .	the c - stick sold me as well , as i 'm left handed and the circle pad pro is not comfortable for me . now i can try playing kid icarus and not have to use the awkward alternate controls !
if country y wants it more , then they should had paid more . maybe i do n't get the business of fifa ?	fifa is a non - profit organisation , making money is not , or at least should not be their goal .
andrew jackson . from the spoils system to the trail of tears , thanks again mr . jackson . let us honor your achievements by placing you on our 20 dollar bill .	yeah john a macdonald is basically the canadian version of him .

yeah , fat people eating food is gross , amirite guise ?	honestly watching a larger person eating a large portion is watching their unhealthy vice or weakness winning .
what really ? how is it a projectile weapon ?	the flamethrower 's flames are actually little boxes . if the hitbox of a flame particle hits a player , they get lit on fire .
density maybe ? i 'm not a scientist , but could n't the smaller planet just be a lot more dense and still maintain an equivalent atmosphere ?	sure . what would be denser than a rocky mantle with an iron core ?
ok so you 're saying you ca n't even boot to safe mode with both sticks , or that you can get to regular mode with one stick ? and so you 're running a partition ?	i can boot into safe mode with one stick . my usual main method of boot is my ssd , my hard drive is where i install most of my programs but it also has a copy of windows on it .

i did like that dive by reigns . does that make me a bad person ?	that mid - air spear was pretty fucking sweet too . broke rollins in half .
you should read your bible . you also forgot to mention jerusalem , you know where the religion started .	and about jerusalem , well your right , but nothing very significant compared to the places i 've mentioned , as since they were being persecuted by the romans as well as the jews .
man , it 's at least semi - socially acceptable to walk around with beats . i feel like a fool in public when i wear my m50s .	i 'd feel like a fool for worrying about what others think of my audio accessories .
i love this small ball mentality . the past two seasons were frustrating because of all the hack and slashing going on . all i remember was 0 - 2 holes .	right ? even if they lose a ton of games this season small ball is so much more fun to watch than what they used to do

oh , this sub will take care of it , i 'm sure . what you posted is n't correct , that means a mod will take it down , you wo n't have to do anything .	the second fact 's true though ; check the source yourself . hope you 're proud , by the way .
do women die that early in germany ?	she may be around when they are young , but it 's also nice to have your parents around when you are an adult .
yep . then blew them out in game 6 in brooklyn . somehow i do n't think this wizards team is going to go down that easy .	i 'm terrified that we are going to play like the bulls did last night . that would be so disappointing a way to end the season with how well we have played this postseason .
i 've been married ten years longer than you 've been alive . not everyone on the internet is young .	oh , so you are just an asshole then . got it . at your age you should really know better than to insult people who have never even been in the job market yet .
well , after the 5th , we 'll just get the extra exp as we unlock it .	does getting it later extend the duration of this particular boost past the others or will all end at the same time ?
something just sounds weird about it , i think your melody and the song 's melody are in differentiating keys , so it makes it sound a bit unpleasant . at least to me anyways .	you 're probably right . i know nothing about the actual music part of making music , just the software part sadly . my greatest downfall : being lazy as fuck .
some companies are required by their internal policies to post jobs externally . they also might not have expected that person to apply initially .	this is more common than many people realize , i think . companies do n't spend the resources to post jobs and interview people just for fun .

was just gonna make one . took you guys long enough . i want either gurley , parker , kevin johnson or trade back . in that order .	i really think our team 's gurley hype has been trade bait for some mid 20 's area team .
i just finished my midterms too . now i can stay up all night on this sub rather than staying up all night to study	and this is why i love my third shift job , read the sub all night , get paid to do it .
fuckers , i 'll meet her at the bus stop with a couple of my dogs and that will put a stop to that bullshit !	the coon town support network . call on it , and angry racists from your area get together to make a stand . i like it .
it seems like you 're singling them out , besides they 're just as bad as others	i 'm singling them out because this is a hip hop discussion board and to add on to other people calling out hip hop fans ?

i think directed verdict is the judge directing the jury . summary judgment comes before the trial .	i have no idea what 's going on in this thread because i 'm an 0l , but judging by the downvotes , i do n't think this is right .
it 's not standing on running server hardware that scares me . it 's the particle board desk straining to hold all that weight .	the whole thing was nope .
as the owner of several copyrights , i dispute the premise that copyrights are duds or otherwise of no worth . they are property and some properties are worth more than others .	a law that is enforced very selectively or not at all is always a bad law , no matter how much you like the idea .

the main character of kite runner . lil punk watched his friend get raped and did n't do anything	i 'm not sure you were supposed to like him for that . pretty sure he was intended as a flawed character who 'd made a mistake as a child and was trying to make it right .
lol yea i would n't have . plus it sucks texting her . she gives like 1 word replies over 30 minutes . but she 's awesome in person c :	ugh ! those kind of people annoy the crap outta me . especially if it 's a crush or something .
that 's fair . i am definitely in a low mmr , so it 's possible that i just have n't gone up against anyone who understands that they should stun my spirit .	honestly i feel like in lower mmr gargantuan is n't that bad . its when you and the teams you play with get more coordinated spirit really starts to shine .
this is what is so puzzling to me . i know it 's just my opinion , but marvel movies are so mediocre . gotg is the only one that really stood out to me as a great movie , the rest are bland .	i agree but hey , as long as people are having fun .
as an original nexus 7 owner , i can confirm the slower flash memory performance over time is definitely an issue .	that 's not planned obsolescence , it 's just asus using low - cost components in order to reduce manufacturing costs . the tablet was obsolete before it was even out .
wait what happened ? he punched reality or something ?	a lot of people do n't like to mention the reality altering punch .
i love terry williams , too . before we signed dan williams , i desperately wanted him as our 1 - tech . i have no idea why he was a senior bowl and combine snub , but he 's gonna be good .	he 's got a lot of off the field issues and has had i think 2 knee injuries but as an ecu student i loved big terry in the middle of our d .

we 're missing out on a bunch of boots and balls that console players get .	ah why of course . the fact that we use their client to play the game through , should of course result in worse quality and experience !
what they need to do is design a stage that can be rotated where the next 2 teams to play is on the other side .	there 's not enough room , unless they took out the stands and made it like season 2 .
maybe you should roll out the aaa every now and then .	every single time i play there 's at least 3 aa in the match . this is not enough to stop tree top level bombers apparently so i think everyone should have to play as aa . sound good ?
i love doing those during brain awareness week ! it 's amazing how quickly middle schoolers shut up when you pull out a brain .	we brought 6 rat brains but they were n't impressed because they dissected a sheep brain in class previously ! the coolest thing i dissected in ms biology was a stupid frog .

it 's a maturity thing . not that there are n't exceptions , of course , but sometimes it 's just nice to have a more mature fan base .	well the odds are that the youth group on csgo is much more mature because they 're on a pc and generally that means their more mature considering they 're not on consoles like most peasants

hey ! brit here . all the truly evil villains in american films are british !	clearly . have n't anyone seen any spy movie ever ?
he should not be allowed to collect any government benefits . self expression is fine , but when you purposefully remove yourself from the job market like this , there should be consequences .	that 's a really good point actually .

cream soda is actually awesome at killing cotton mouth .	very true . that 's actually the only drink i 've ever been able to find that gets rid of cotton mouth other than water
or just a big trebuchet , really .	more of a catapult , like the ones used to launch planes from carriers .
never heard of dolphin emulator before . i was expecting a game where you ran around as a dolphin doing dolphin things in the same spirit as goat simulator . looks awesome though .	i watched the entire rogue squadron video waiting to see dolphins .
it 's social acceptance . it is n't socially acceptable to eat cats and fuck your sister . that 's one hell of an over thought , though .	of course it 's social acceptance . the whole point of the ad was to challenge what 's socially acceptable . but , hey , sorry to make you think too hard .
did you take that picture ? drone or did you climb a tree ?	are you serious ? i think he is in the second story of his house which is uphill from the house he photographed .
but that was less a game than a social service .	well you do play it . and it does count when we are listing kh on mobile platforms .
i totally get that . that 's how i would do it , too . kids are dumb and short sighted . that does n't mean that your or my plans extend to every parent on the planet , though .	there is no rationale beyond extreme hypotheticals for granting access to that kind of money to a child . some things are objectively stupid .
because the one - shot search icon functionality does that now , and you can use a dozen search engines without having to remember a dozen keywords , and you can do it with a single click .	that 's definitely useful for people who use their mouse to browse , but i do n't do that .

when i 'm a passenger of a car looking outside of the window , i play a game where i imagine a little dude jumping over the trees and buildings .	i like listening to music in cars as a passenger , and that usually leads me to looking out the windows and following the beat of the song by bouncing my vision from car to car .
all i know is that 343 and microsoft 's names are on the front of the box , and that they are ultimately responsible for the outcome of their product .	i still do n't really get why 343 's name is on it , they only made like a quarter of it .
i watched on roku , and there were n't any ads . the video paused for a half second two or three times per episode , so i 'm guessing that 's where the ads were supposed to be .	their roku app is pretty great though .

btw why is it called real estate and not just estate ?	estates cover more than just real property . we do n't deal with the other aspects , just the real property .

i 've learned to drive with my finger tips .	or if you do it just with the top of your palm it 's moderately bearable .

i often still have trouble with round and square toes . fashion recently has had them narrow in height at the toe . fucking sucks .	suddenly very glad my goto shoes are sneakers and snow boot right now . i 'm going to have to buy dress shoes eventually .
personal preference was n't the question .	actually , yes , asking what brushes to get does mean he is asking for our personal preference . there is no wrong or right answer , it is all opinion .
i heard motherfucker had like 30 goddamn dicks .	he 's also six foot eight and weighs a fucking ton .
sweden 's perception of the us is that a lot of its people there are probably stupid enough to think that this is anywhere near true .	so you 're claiming that sweden is n't the most tolerant country in all of europe ?
a decision to start killing other people so you do n't get killed yourself , is still a decision . they chose they valued their life over that of others .	yeah , but even the law allows you to kill for self - preservation . it 's not immoral , let alone illegal .
it was me and i already paid . i promise . honest	hmm . seems legit
exactly this . if you need to type , it becomes pretty painful when you are used to dvorak to change .	i can no longer touch type qwerty from the get go , but after a few minutes typing on it glancing at the keys when i need to i get back into the swing of it .
they 'll have to rely on intercontinental ballistic missiles and long range stealth bombers now .	nope , armed aircraft are prohibited . you can only use the icbm .

change the spray bottle to vinegar . it 's non - toxic , just aim away from the face . they do n't like the smell .	keep it watered down though , and used sparingly . while it is n't toxic , it 's still acidic and can cause troubles if too much is ingested . also some cats are weird and like the smell .
pekka is already a girl .	barbs are male , and archers are female ?
no automated system can reliably remove nasty videos and not also take down perfectly innocent videos . humans , of course , are n't perfect , but they 're a lot more reliable .	idk man . i 've been surprised too many times with what i 've seen bots do before to say it ca n't be done
i do n't know if it 's just the photo , but i find the end - point of the sash to be really annoying , like it should go at least a bit further . maybe that 's just me .	i find the whole fucking sash bothering . if they insist to put the sash why do n't they make it a bit thinner and maybe just reduce the annoying size of aia ?
that 's kind of what i was thinking of doing , but i 'm trying to be gentle about it .	no need to be gentle . if he was doing anything else unethical that you thought was wrong would you help him do it ?

they do ? i never knew . cool . that , and egg moves are possible .	i am trying for female but males also do pass down the hidden ability due to the update in x and y but it 's more likely for a female to pass it down
because permanent banning would n't be permanent , obviously . it kinda defeats the purpose .	yeah , it does . but it allows innocent people who got banned for something they did n't do to buy back their accounts . support does n't help , they keep sending me same messages .

yep . if you 're an older tourist who ca n't hike a trail , this is one of the better places to see bears in alaska .	to be quite frank i do n't think very many people going hiking with hopes of seeing a bear anyways .
which part of stem do you work at ?	the sm , where they do n't make any money
leblanc seems like the most obvious next step . then you can break into ad champs with zed . katarina is good too .	i tried katarina but she is totally not my play style , although she seems to be so good is n't leblanc kinda hard to learn ? i m only lvl 24

i believe one guy is in charge of the music , and the other is in charge of the animation	who does the vocals for the kid character ?
i 'm worried too . sales are below 20 , 000 . and the covers are n't exactly the most appealing , on top of a character that many prematurely judge as generic . we 'll see .	the story is good , but the art is so hit or miss .
this is actually a difficult one for me to choose . he 's on fire as a babyface right now but he 's a much better heel	well , most everybody 's better as a heel really . its easier to get people to hate you than to like you as i always say . edit : shit spelling

as much as it is a beautiful setting , it is a bit sad that rapture city from bioshock is technically not possible .	it is certainly possible . it would just require an absurd amount of resources . it does n't seem to provide any tangible payoff either .
i know you 'd like to think it 's still cool but is n't . i 've had plenty of drake and lil wayne listening kids roll their eyes at me for trying to play them some dre and snoop .	for example , if i whip out my piano man at full blast and sing to the sky , i may get a few looks .
diesel engines do not have spark plugs period , they fire based on compression alone . i do think the battery should remain removable though , especially on these old cars we have .	you are absolutely correct . i was referring to the diesel glow plug which is needed to start a diesel engine . it is not a spark plug , and diesel engines do not have spark plugs .
ties will be broken by a 26 mile three legged race .	confirmed : josh wise wins all ties , becomes 2015 champion .

i miss the shot counter .	same ! why do other networks not pick up on that shit ?
anything that might interest u for an extra scrap ?	actually the bank set sounds pretty cool .
i ca n't wait to watch this . i suppose i should be slightly embarrassed i 've only seen and heard of marky marks .	it 's a really fun movie . the ending is one of the best car chases i 've seen .
that 's great for me living in switzerland . buying stuff from abroad is very cheap now . we will see how it will affect the industry .	since you barely have any industry and mostly wash money i think you 'll be just fine .
i should have made myself more clear , i 'm looking to join a game that would be okay having a newbie play with them .	i think i may have miss understood your request i thought you were looking to be in a game in person seems your looking for online . sorry about that ,
so palestinians are the bullies ? if i go to your home and seize it all but a room for you to live in , would n't you resist ?	the arabs did n't resist to anything , they opened a war against the jewish minority in the middle east , like they open wars against other minorities or people from other religions .
sorry . i was talking about stocks . i thought your ability to predict , with perfect accuracy , how people will interact in all circumstances should be bringing you a significant return .	sadly , i am currently no longer in the stock trading game . stressed me out too much . i prefer low - risk , low - returns .
thanks . yeah , i way overthink these things too so i get the anxious feeling .	yea i try and not over - analyze but its hard sometimes lol
if you 're running a long race you better protect your nipples	this is why i always run marathons in pasties .
i have no clue but i 'm willing to bet chip makes a run for him .	do n't you dare put the image of eli in an eagles jersey in my mind .
communism is n't just about the economic system , it 's about abolishing the state as well . the ussr themselves did n't even fall through with it .	libertarians more or less call for abolishing the state as well . in fact that is what they run on . i do n't see them being impeached .
i 'm not quite at your level yet , but if you 're an aspiring producer , how do you get your music dropped at festivals ? do you dj yourself at gigs , or do you just ask people to do it ?	knowing djs is a good place to start . i know a few djs from my hometown and send them my music every once in a while and one of my tracks actually got played at a show with astronaut .
did n't you see there was like more to the house from the outside lol sorry it 's making more sense in my head .	haha , this is the wall between my living room and bedroom . so my couch is on the other side of where the door is . this is the original exterior before the house was expanded years ago
that 's really cool . i wish my school did that	you can still be inducted into the order if you want . you could also try and get your university to become a link in the chain .
yup . i 'd like to hear these walls , lie to kick it , and momma on the radio , too	luckily , radio is much less important today than it used to be . the way people access their music is mostly online .
i 'd have to say season 4 . it seemed like it would be very fitting for the show to start and end with a boy in blood .	yup . as someone who is watching for the first time and just finished season 4 , that would 've been the most epic finale ever . i kind of do n't want the show to continue .
do you have a link ? that sounds pretty interesting , and i 'd like to find out more .	i saw it on tv . pretty sure it was on pbs . try pbs . org and do a search for spiders
basically . this was an ethics course for medical school .	the fact that this douche may be a doctor one day terrifies me .
haha . im travelling thru mexico right now and picking up this thread on random wifi here and there . i should just stop .	nice man , enjoy your trip !
what 's everyone 's opinion on eliminating civs from the game ? i usually leave them a crappy city because they are no longer a threat and the warmonger penalty seems to stay lower .	it depends on how much they annoyed me tbh . taking every single one of their cities and leaving them one is n't much better on the warmonger aspect as just wiping them out completely anymore
i really do n't get why everyone on this sub seems to get stuck in the fucking mud .	maybe because its so goddamn fun , that could be why .
is n't any worse than the eagles 's subreddit being cowboys second . their frontpage is basically our frontpage . they have more cowboys news than we do in there .	there 's one article about the cowboys there , and it 's the same one as this one . stop being so dramatic .
last week , 2009 , its all the same .	time does n't exist on the internet , perhaps today 's post is a repost of tomorrow .
that 's the real solution to assholes parking in your prepaid parking space .	guaranteeing the car will still be in your space tomorrow .
i 'll just be here , in my motel room , on my data pad .	no , you 're going to go to the beach at least once and relax some . maybe becky can get a volleyball game set up later .
that europe is a continent .	i think that eurasia is a continent , not europe .
if it helps , we can talk about how sjw 's in europe are arresting people for offensive tweets .	or putting up female quotas in management and insisting on it to the point that the position will remain vacant if no qualified women applies for it .
i would rather be put down than to starve to death or to be eaten by predators .	that 's what you want though , and not necessary what the cats want . maybe they prefer to live free , ya know ?
that looks amazing , the colors are great ! did you use paint pens ?	i used montana acrylic paint pens for everything except the blue and flesh on the general . those i had to mix custom colors and paint with a brush
uptown funk . it is played once an hour on every single radio station and it has just gotten beyond irritating .	i 'm kinda proud to say i 've never heard this song .
serious question : is there any technique to achieve the same result , but shield your face in a way that the ball cannot land between your arms and smack you on the nose ?	yes . turn your head . worst case you get it smack on the side of your face .
but nh does n't have the largest population of pre meds like california does	that does n't make it any worse for nh residents or people from any other state without a medical school . i 'd still rather be a cali resident .
because wherever you find trees you find man killing animals ? have you ever actually gone outside ?	yes . and every time i 've fought off animal attacks . two squirrels once . and a hummingbird . i do n't go in forests anymore .
yes , the kid is 11 and has asked my younger sis out and she politely said no both times . his response was to always cuss her out , endlessly call her , and be terribly rude to her .	then you need to be the big brother and punch this little shit . how did you get a pic of this piece of shit ? does he have facebook ?
i tried that on family members , but my cat somehow knows it 's not supposed to jump on people .	i think you 've got one of those rare , good cats . mine know what we do n't like so they do it . 10x more destructive than our dog .
just watched a short documentary - like video on the peyton manning - ryan leaf draft . makes me not want to pick winston .	link for the video ? always interested in the leaf story as a charger fan who only got into this sport a few years ago
you would think a small refinery would be worth building there .	ca n't build any new refinery 's for the most part . also small refinery 's are n't that profitable .
nyquist . ericsson has n't been great either , but my expectations for nyquist were so much higher , and he 's been invisible since the all star game .	i think people expected him to be a pure goal scorer when he 's much more of a play maker like zetterberg , although i 'm a little disappointed in that shooting percentage .
they should make fireteams only play with other fireteams . that allows solo players to actually win and fireteams to have an actual challenge .	they already try to do this . if you 're in a pre - made fireteam , ib will typically favor other pre - made teams . though not always
who won the debate ?	nobody . you seem to imply that reiterating arguments in a debate is a good idea .
i used to have an afterburner front light mod , but just removed it and installed a ags - 101 screen , this thing is a beauty !	do you know if there 's anywhere to still buy an afterburner kit ? i ca n't find one online .
some time within the first week of last december .	yeah wow that 's a lot . i put some good mileage on mine but my commute will be half of what it is after a month
i stand corrected , i still wo n't be mad until he does n't show up to work . until then , all we can do is speculate .	hopefully he will come to his senses soon . i cant believe anyone would take a 4 to 5 million dollar pay cut because of one person in the front office .
more stories ! more !	thanks ! check out my post history and sort by top . i think you 'll like the story of the bed and the mikes
whaaat ! i have n't played tp yet ! this music gave me the chills !	play it ! it 's my favourite zelda game to date ! : d
it 's price is going down alittle bit . therefore , as the enemy turns was the biggest complaint , i see no reason to not buy it when its in a good price zone .	where is its price going down ? i enjoyed the demo , apart from the waiting , and i assume the game gets better later on . might be worth a look .
you 're better off . it took me 30 years to quit and even now it crosses my mind several times a day .	how 'd you do it ? maybe i can pass some advice to my family .
i am more interested in the dude who thinks he 's a unicorn . i bet he 's just another fucking rhino that painted himself white and put on a wig . lying bastard .	take a god damn upvote . i cracked up laughing .
i 'm never selling on ebay . fuck that .	i just sold something last week , now i 'm extremely happy i did n't get fucked . especially since it was used electronics .
i use my xperia z ultra to read twitter in the shower every morning without issue . i recommend it !	it 's a moot point for me as mine is definitely no longer waterproof , but i 'll keep it in mind for my next phone .
their defense is bad enough that routine plays are a treat for them . at least in the outfield .	can confirm . and our infield has actually been the surprise liability .
if she was the girl of my dreams she would not be long distance for long so it 's kind of a moot point .	what if you meet someone start dating , and then for whatever reason they have to go away for a while ? what would be your limit on how long you can wait ?
i feel the pressure to stay alive because of my mother . it would really hurt her if i went through with it but i just do n't have the will or motivation to go through every day like this .	this is my exact reasoning too . i just hurts so bad thinking about how my mother and sister would feel if i left them
i guess i could go work for a police department if my current gig did n't work out .	i wanted to go fd . probably should have . now i 'd take too much of a pay cut to swap . gad dammit .
you apparently have n't seen the australian party guy . too lazy to link a video .	there is something to be said for sticking to your guns . or in this case your sunglasses .
agreed . what dei did was just an element to the paint scheme , penske is just using the same damn paint scheme in different colors .	uh , that 's exactly what dei did too . base color , off colored pillars , stripes .
why is n't it fucking a car tho	you know man , i thought about that when i photographed it !
i ca n't access anything in steam community or even my own profile , so it 's probably just a steam problem .	tuesday is maintenance day . steam should be back in a matter of minutes .
im guessing that trailer doesnt dump the bales ?	nope but you can load 2 wide the whole length and then put another row on top of that .
world war z is great .	i 've listened to that one too . the audio book is a lot of fun .
lorac pro palette price ?	sorry , i 'm not selling the pro anymore ! do you mean the mega pro ?
the mobo has a whole bunch of ports on the back , i 'm hoping for a software solution but so far no luck .	oh , i understand . i 've seen bundled software that does that . which os are you running ?
anyone think there is an opportunity to get jv mid range jays ? no one guards him out there .	his not too quick . not sure he can run the bases .
they say human meat tastes like pork , so probably more like a piglet i 'm guessing .	i 've heard veal more than pork
never make fun of someones orgasm face .	my ex did this to me . after that i was never able to relax during sex with him . the o face he made fun of was the last one he ever saw .
why is george washington always portrayed in the painting on the wall ? i feel like he was invited but felt too cool to go . aha	i think it 's that he was anti partisan , so he does n't fit with the republicans or democrats , but you kinda need him in the pics since he is among the greatest of all the presidents .
yeah that 's why every single time i see you post you 're being an ass to people for no reason . you clearly have issues	do n't let the internet troll get to ya bud
preach , how is this conversation always so one sided . i used to get annoyed but now it 's just fascinating	in no other discussion on here is one side so shamelessly downvoted for voicing an opinion .
really ? was n't it the scene where he was peeing ?	pee scene was earlier in the movie . so yes there are 2 completely different o - face hank scenes
my college planted those trees all over the place . during spring , the whole campus smells like cum	i 'm surprised that every college does n't smell like that year - round
holy shit . rda 's striking	ca n't believe how fast he improved .
yeah like that time india never beat pakistan in a war . oh wait . disclaimer : i know not all indians are vegetarian , but the percentage is definitely higher than pakistan 's .	it was the indian army not the general population which beat pakistan and the indian army consumes much more meat and alcohol than the average indian .
what makes you think that it 's right in any case ? a big portion of it was the domestic espionage going on , though .	did you even read my post ?
i never noticed it before , but s - canary has the best face mask of all the heroes . black canary needs to lose hers and steal s - canary 's one .	is n't that what she did ? took her wig , jacket , and mask ? only difference is that laurel does n't put makeup to hide her eyes like oliver and sara .
yea , actually . do n't buy into the nasl is evil narrative and you 'd be surprised how well they 've done on the business side .	i 've always thought nasl did a good job with their league . i just was n't sure if this was corporate heads taking credit for other people 's work or not .
losing 1 in a row to tech just makes you want to lose your will to live .	maybe that 's why we lose to you guys so much . we purposely lose because we know the state would n't survive if we win .
is that really any different from any other country 's politicians though ?	well to be fair , perhaps not really .
you can always get your first month free as a trial .	i could n't , i joined just at the end of march and there was no codes . it sounds like i can cancel and use the code for next month though , hopefully .
jesus christ that buttery smooth framerate - my machine is pretty high end but i still do n't get framerate like that .	granted , i do disable a majority of the eye - candy - what are your specs ? i find that warframe is generally low - end friendly if you keep things down .
i lost 3 out of 3 games against mech mage , what am i doing wrong ? maybe you can do a guide ? i won every other game . nice deck btw	it 's cool , it just means you 're going to win the next 29 mech mage matchups .
there are very large signs in airports in indonesia clearly outlining the consequences of drug smuggling in that country . they were not unaware .	i 'm talking about the public of australia .
one ca n't hope to stop the jimmy , merely slow it down .	you can run but you ca n't hide .
is it time to start considering some roster changes for clg ? fns isnt a good igl and his fragging ability doesnt make up for it .	it 's time to make a roster change if they want to be like the rest of na and never reach the level of eu teams .
what is your favorite movie starring a record store owner and why is it high fidelity ?	my favorite record store scene in film is a clockwork orange .
have you heard nothing about swedes hunting soviet submarines by noise during cold war , spending a lot of money on that and finding out those noises were fish farts ?	your point is ?
she gave him free access to guns ? did n't he kill her first and take them . does n't seem very free to me .	are you not aware that her death was one event in a life which contains thousands of events ? to try and extrapolate the entirety just from the fact that she died is silly .
addiction is indeed a health issue inherently . but the rest of your post does n't change my view . although the doing drugs to be accepted point gave me food for thought . thanks !	my key point is that doing drugs is n't a smart choice , but we need to examine the circumstances that lead to people making these poor choices in the first place .
so essentially , you serve on a vessel in the interim between basic and a school ? this might sound dumb , but what exactly is watch standing ; is it guard duty ?	on a vessel or a land unit such as a sector or small boat station . standing watch is listening for vessels in distress or helping vessels with navigation within your area of responsibility .
no poise is in the game , same with equipment burden . those are gone	very happy to hear about the lack of equipment burden . i know it makes sense in terms of strategy and game design , but to me managing weapon weight always seems like such a chore .
srsly tho , why has nobody hired wilson after his tenure as a leaf coach ? also , has carlyle been hired yet ?	wilson will never work again after he threw the caps management under the bus for admitting they lost games intentionally in 2000 .
see my earlier comment about hatred of guinea pigs . zero empathy for them , the more noise they make the faster i want them dead .	that 's how i feel about trolls .
good eye contact is important . is it better to err on the side of too much or too little in formal settings e . g . a job interview ?	better yet , how long am i supposed to hold it before i 'm allowed to stare at an object ? i can do about tops 3 seconds .
it 's not about the nail . do you ever listen ?	you sound exactly like my ex .
yeah , it was used correctly . i read that a condom does n't always protect against hpv but i figured it ca n't hurt either . i would never have sex without protection .	i have had sex with over 300 different guys and am still clean and healthy , thanks to condoms , if that makes you feel any better .
yeah , i miss the alchemy book from 2nd gen .	me too . i 'd be happy with alchemist being a title though . instead i earned nothing for all my effort .
any idea why he shut it down ?	he thought he was getting to big and did n't take well to the spotlight . decided to cash his chips before he crashed and burned .
from what i know , babies are super tired after all the stress from delivery ! try waking her to feed , but do n't get too worried yet ? congrats !	thanks ! she finally got hungry and ate on and off for 40 minutes !
they have nothing to do with each other yes some of the zombies look like feral ghouls but does walking dead remind you of fallout ? no . does the book of eli remind you of fallout ? yes .	i was leaning more toward hoping the open world aspect being similar . aside from fallout and skyrim i 've yet to find a game that does that for me . i love the exploration of both .
if we 2 - 0 king tomorrow then king do n't own tiebreaker .	it depends . if king ends with more 2 - 0s , or we finishes with longer game time against them , king still owns the tie - breaker .
little back up power packs are crazy cheap now .	tap water is crazy cheap too . bottled water is still a huge business . convenience .
are we abandoning ship ? honest question .	just start telling everyone we 're going to digg instead now . then , let 's not .
wow , i liked this one so much , i posted it here 9 hours ago . do you bother to look at the sub before you post ?	congrats . we posted the same art from different sources . fuck me for making an honest mistake !
do n't worry guys ! this stuff will all blow over , and no one will be bringing it up regularly nearly a decade later .	honestly the falcons were so terrible last year i really did n't even care when i found out .
instability can be very tough on kids . how are you doing these days ?	i did n't expect anyone to reply - sweet of you . i 'm ok , it was a long time ago and i 'm close to 40 now .
you wo n't feel it now but if you keep sending off draft picks your farm system is going to be depleted in a few years .	we 've been feeling this lately , from 5 - 6 years ago .
juice boxes , bologna and cheese sandwiches , riding my bike around aimlessly , and drive - in movies with my friends .	i am so lucky that we still have a drive - in 15 minutes away . i feel so sad that some people will never be able to see a drive - in movie .
then you were n't done . but yeah i know what you mean , after the gym sometimes i just want to go hunt my dinner .	or fuck something . working out does engage a lot of primal drives .
man that ending got me . especially the overhead shot when you see brian 's white toyota supra split from dom 's charger .	correct me if i 'm wrong but during the montage did they leave out the scene from 2 fast 2 furious where tyrese and paul shake hands on the pier ? if so , it should 've been added .
we call that a shit storm randy .	holy fuck !
look for the os key sticker and use it .	long story short , a company closed down and i got this laptop . the os sticker was stripped off . i was looking for it underneath , but no dice .
prostitution would go through the roof !	another business venture worth investing in ! first the hotels and then the pimp slaps !
that 's not really the point . this is a non - story that a right wing website is using to prop up it 's agenda . i just think we could do without that kind of bullshit in this sub .	pretty sure the non - story is the one we read a couple weeks ago about how sarah silverman got paid 10 bucks for a gig that another guy got paid 60 for .
but now you see tip jars in subway and the like . and the payment machine asks you about tips .	those employees are n't making their wages from the tips , it 's just a little extra bonus .
s - sorry . i did n't see it submitted anywhere and do n't see it on your submissions page .	you backed down , why do n't you just show him your pussy now ?
i wo n't be able to sleep . meep .	why , do you have a nice warm engine bay in your bed ?
your thoughts ? i personally would have liked to see more of a design in it . i 'm sure they play well though .	i really like them , super comfy . they surprisingly have a lot of detail in person , yet subtle . just like the tongue
i only try to kill fat civilians in gta v . feel like i 'm doing my part to make gta online a better place .	has it annoyed you that fatties run just as fast as everyone else in the game . i hope next game they fix that .
the thing is , i 'm not sure if he 's actually trolling because his numbers and stuff were accurate .	oh . that makes it more difficult than lol . it can be hard to decide whether or not to argue something if you are n't sure how serious the other person is .
i think he meant the part where happy takes out the fish , it 's very similar to what sakura is doing in this image .	well i suppose you could find more scenes where people take out some fish , what 's the context on that image ? is she scared like happy or something ?
it 's supposed to be fun for kids to watch	ah ok . in that case it 's cool . regardless , amazing special effects .
i do n't think they make holes big enough for gopro cameras . myth busters ?	they do . gold holes are a lot bigger than most people think .
yummy melted cheese .	nice , my favourite at the moment is peanut butter
can we leave a jar out for donations ? that 'll work right ?	nah . you can pay
maybe the delivery was n't perfect but she was perfectly logical in her reasoning . made sense what else do you want ?	to feel alive again martin .
i 'm not sure what you mean by economic democracy .	voting based on how you participate in the economy .
you can get a bit weaker than that cant ya ?	part 1 is n't crazy powerful
i prefer pens . being a lefty , it can be hard to write in pencil and not get it all over my hand .	as a fellow southpaw , i feel your pain . pencil - smudge hand is the worst .
they really nailed the streaming video this time around . no stutters or hiccups whatsoever .	and no foreign translations in the background audio !
you do n't find ignorant whites as bad ?	i have never seen a ignorant white person burn a city to the ground , or demonize a person to an entire country when he was defending himself from some thug kid .
so is roman reigns going to set up to sell autographs in the subway station next ?	he can put ambrose and rollins 'names in the ad and say they are in the bathroom .
when it 's your signature song and you play it a billion times between 1968 and 1996 , the odds of coincidence of dying shortly after playing it go up dramatically .	my first thought was , for how much of his life was he more than an hour from singing that stupid song ?
most likely the end of the cable did n't fit through that tiny little hole . why even have that plastic cover ? why not just the hole ?	the entire top of the plastic grommet comes off and the cable runs through the opening .
oh man , if i did n't know you , i was temporarily tempted to downvote this comment .	im having a lot of fun doing this for some reason haha . i 'm gonna stop after this game tho
have you been to the dinosaur museum ?	it 's called natural history museum . to repel children , i think .
i feel your pain , having to explain the concept of supply , demand and price equilibrium in a trading card game subreddit was rather taxing .	i assume the kid was thirteen or older so how the fuck does he not know basic economics ? he needs to pick up a newspaper .
