of all the things i learned getting my comp sci degree , git was not one of them . i understand what it is , but i have no freaking clue how to use it . damnit .	only takes a few hours to learn how to use it effectively , and you wo n't regret spending the time !
in a way learning the map is how you level up in the game . after your first few deaths you have a much better understanding of where things are that you need to survive .	add the map with a compass or watching the sun with no player indicator on map and that would ideal for this kind of game .
i 'm shocked . there 's your group qualifying at plate tracks , brian france .	i 'm not . it was bound to happen sooner or later . now it 's happened and everyone involved is some level of pissed .
this worked great . now do you have any solutions for an audio sync issue and slight stuttering ?	i think that is just the lag of streaming live video over wifi to the chromecast . i bought a cheap mini - display - to - hdmi adapter specifically for the game .

i dont mean to be rude but why is it such a big deal ?	it 's a possibly sick baby with people who care about its well being and people are posting these pictures everywhere that the mother is eventually going to see .

falcao 's style is much more suited to a technical league like in spain and italy .	i dont think he has any technique left anymore . hope he has a good summer break of rehabilitation and he plays well for whichever team he joins .
this girl is ludicrously attractive . holy 7 gods .	there is only one god , and every man knows his gifts . tits . and wine .

the book had the same character . so why the movie , not the book ?	i did n't read the book ! that 's why i specified movie , i cannot attest to the books contents .
does it come in a black version ? i 'm not seeing an option for it so i figured i 'd ask . white mice like this tend to turn yellow and pretty gross looking over time .	a little late , but i have a black one and i love the thing . great for a wide range of games with the number pad .
off the top of my head , and without regard to spoilers : tara wash fred ? echo 's battlestar boyfriend phil	well he also killed coulson but marvel decided to marvel him back to life . notice that whedon did n't put him in this latest avengers though .

this is not related but seriously the sand snakes suck . thank you for reading .	sand snakes rule !
murph , i love you , forever . as a father with a young daughter this movie tore me up much more than it should .	god damnit that movie is beautiful .
mostly the government .	you 'd think if there was one take - away from this ama it would be that we should n't confuse the ambitions of the power elite with the common citizen , but no .

speaking of noob questions , what happens if i purchase a vehicle , but not a property without a garage ? do i keep it and have to call someone or does it vanish ?	you cannot buy a car from the website without a garage . the car gets delivered to the garage , and then you get it from said garage .
how zooms suit will change colors in the future .	you think that zoom roasted a red suit to get it to look like that ? he could n't just design a yellow suit ?
i think mkg has the potential to even pass lillard . mkg is several years younger than dame and could end up being a better two way player .	but he 's terrible on offense . some people on this sub have no idea what 2 - way player means . just because he 's good defensively does n't mean he 'll be elite at both ends .

until nixon , taiwan was one of the big 5 and officially recognized as a country . nixon flipped it to mainland china , so now taiwan as a murky status .	you 're missing a big fact that taiwan was on the security council well after the roc was relegated to just taiwan .

oh that 's right ! i do have rocksmith and my brother 's old guitar but have never gotten around to playing it . thanks for the recommendation i think i 'll do this .	it takes rock band to a whole new level . it 's very accurate . i have a friend who is becoming quite proficient at playing the bass , and he has n't even been playing for a year .

have you considered selling your items to people who actually have money ?	being on campus makes that pretty hard .
goalies need a team in front of them unfortunately . especially when they 're still learning . they fell apart in front of pete and he 's not ready to shoulder that kind of load .	you 're absolutely right . it 's the same thing that happened in the last game against ottawa . goalies ca n't be perfect , and with nobody helping him , you 're not going to win many games .
a bite of china - not just food , but also rich culture behind the food .	bbc and cctv did another cooperation called wild china which is also good . it 's a 6 episode series focusing on different rural parts of china and the people and wildlife that can be found there
i struggle with the group by function a lot when i know it 's really straight forward . are there any recommended sites for learning it properly as at the moment it 's just trial and error .	just remember you 're making the data distinct on the column in the group by and then must aggregate everything else
right , but it 's just like the locks : if they want to screen your bag , they can . if they choose to steal from your bag , they 'll cut them open and say that your bag was screened .	when your bag is searched , there is a tsa note inside .
if you get into a wreck while turning left , you can pretty much count on being found at fault , unless the other guy ran a red light or was speeding excessively .	this is why i never turn left if i 'm waved through by someone in the first lane , while the second lane appears to be open . it 's just not worth it .
have those two came out of the closet yet ?	they do n't need to , they 're fine the way they are , even if they are hiding their secret from us poorly .

personal enjoyment and dev experience . i do plan on selling it though once pre - orders for the cv1 come around .	just do n't expect to get much money from it , as who in their right minds would buy a dk2 after the commercial headsets release ?

it looks like it impaled his penis , which could prevent him from achieving erections in the future .	if i am not mistaken , it looks to me like the dong end is covered with that towel .
he was serving the public by issuing a traffic citation . let 's not pretend she was n't speeding . the public having safe roads is more important than some old lady 's feelings being hurt .	he was not serving the public by escalating a situation and attempting to arrest her . police escalation is not serving the public . this is probably why his superior let her go after arriving .
guild wars 2 does that kinda thing .	thanks for the suggestion . i have played it but after years of wow i am sorta over the mmo thing .
there 's a huge lc next to the grant park co - op , so that 's nice . best of both worlds .	i love the setup . the only thing that could make that lc better is if they offered the growler bar for refills .

yeah , sometime even a mild hangover can trigger a week long depression for me .	that 's because alcohol is a huge depressant . weed can be too , but alcohol is known to exacerbate symptoms .

how did they chose them ? were they illegal or not paying their taxes , etc ?	i think it was just because they were convicted of a serious crime .
he 's an 84 year old man that could 've killed him you piece of shit .	but it did n't , and he 's thankfully fine . i 'm sure no one would 've made jokes had it had been a lot more serious .
god damn it , it made me cry .	then you feel my pain .

and a communist !	i thought he was socialist ?
they were most likely in an area that was too far for them to get some food . theres different factors as to why people starve and its not just the amount of food you have .	they 've all been people within the town near some sort of storage or market , not anywhere out in the woods doing a death march .
damn . their spaghetti sauce is just so cheap though .	make your own sauce with a can of tomatoes .
did people really not realize that was a joke ? i 'm losing faith in the master race .	you 'd be surprised how many people do n't have that particular sense of humor .
i think all hard drives fail either after , or at the exact moment you are done using them .	jokes on you , i use my failed hard drives as weapons . acquire sock , add hard drive to sock , flail drive of doom .

the original title is more clickbait , i edited it to make it more clear .	but she was n't arrested because she was willing to conduct gay weddings . she was arrested because she would n't leave when told to .

do n't show up even a second late . hell , do n't even show up exactly on time .	my rule is at least 15 minutes early . gives me time to sit , collect myself , go over notes and mentally relax before it starts .
you do n't ask about the personal life of porn stars when they 're porn stars . give them some privacy since they get - 1 privacy points at work .	maybe i 'm wrong but is n't up to the porn star to determine this for themselves ?

pretty much it could be summed by the fact that i suck at platformers .	oh then i definitely see how dk frustrates you . shit is fucked , yo .
upset of the day : tip beat tsm .	they kinda got rolled by team 8 for the majority of the game yesterday . i know the circlejerk is that maybe tsm has a weak early game but i dunno , that would be a huge upset .
that 's what i mean . ccp will prevent it or they will lose players .	except we do n't want the south and east ? hell , fuck knows what we 're gonna do with delve , we do n't even want the space . probably give it to bni or something .
there 's a parting in the middle . it 's just begging to be split into two and braided . beautiful .	that part is there for that reason . when working around moving parts i braid it up to keep it safe

by live , i meant live servers . sorry for any misunderstanding .	yeah but i dont remember them patching the test server onto the live client .
almost every app except whatsapp , the camera , the microphone and the web browser . if i use the rest , the battery wo n't last .	this . for how amazing phones are now , just playing a game to pass the time on the train will kill your battery . i miss going a week before needing to charge my old nokia
too many non lawyers giving advice on this sub without any idea of what the law is or how it applies . good on you for clarifying .	very kind of you to say . thank you .

a mans children should n't pay for his crimes .	maybe a real man would n't put his children in that situation .
on the bright side , even if you did n't get away with it , it 's not like they can send you to double - prison or anything .	and that 's why sending people to prison longer for rape than murder is a bad idea .
if my team has a dip , i 'll change the formation throughout the sheets anyway .	ah fair enough . my first team xi usually plays the same formation most games and i adjust the tactics so i use the reserves for some variance in my formation
it 's located in the north west suburbs of chicago .	the store is too cool , there are a few of them in the chicagoland area . lots of hello kitty , anime , general cute merch . guess that includes ponies now !

they should put a mask on baron corbin and make him a new kane - esque character .	as well as having him wrestle in some type of shirt so we do n't have to see those god awful tattoos
i bet it has something to do with them rebooting the series and wanting to control all legal access to the original series for licensing reasons . edit : mini series not reboot	or the blu - rays could be coming finally . perhaps they 've been waiting for the streaming rights to lapse before they sell them .
yeah i definitely would n't want him to leave ! gina is my favourite . she 's so funny .	yea , she 's awesome . she sums up sarcasm in one person . my favorite is jake because i 'm so much like him it 's scary

i move that we add it to the boy scout oath and make it a mandatory prayer at the pole every day in public schools .	that 'll only work if you can get the school administrators to stop using the pole for their daily stripper shows .
you said you used 7 - 8 squirrels . now is that enough for a whole family meal kind of serving or does it only make enough for a couple servings ?	it yielded a ton of pulled meat . three of us are some and it looked like we did n't even touch the supply . it filled a giant pyrex bowl .
is this true ? i thought dark skinned people could get burned too .	they can it 's just harder for them too . they do n't turn red , and that was more my thinking in my first response , but exposure to the sun for too long will fuck any body up .
student - athlete who is working and has an internship here . i have voted in every election i was eligible for . if you believe something is important you will find the time .	excellent point . as they say , if you want something done , ask a busy person .
did he just trick you into giving him a star ?	nah , i gave him a ! star on purpose . they 're basically just another upvote and are n't very useful so they 're like free candy basically lol
congratulations on posting another fantastic reason why we should get rid of the human rights act and replace it with a british bill of rights .	this kind of thing would n't be in the british bill of rights sorry . i think people who are vocally in favour of it would actually be pretty disappointed by the reality of it !
ok try this , join a low or medium pop server . play on it for about 5 - 10 minutes and try again . let me know if that works .	hmm interesting that worked for some reason but now my tab button wont work to see my inventory haha never had this many bugs logging in before ill try restarting to see if that helps .

waiting to see the first iron man with a spirit shield . that would be amazing	is that possible ? did n't they take the safe spot out ? or could you just keep dying and running back and hope nobody hits it

rain season , death , hurricane season , construction . - texas	i 'm confused by this , are n't death season , hurricane season , and construction all summer , stretching into fall ?

it 's the density that causes it to stay a black hole . the black hole may lose mass , but the size also gets smaller , meaning the density is preserved and it stays in it 's black hole state .	hmm . so in theory , anything with mass no matter how light can become a black hole if it is compressed small enough . is there a specific density which an object has to be to pull light in ?

erotica novels are equally taboo if not more so in american culture .	this is true . 50 shades of grey is a massive exception . and it got so much press because of it . i doubt posters can name another commonly known erotic novel .
has that been written ? i ca n't find it online ?	i just meant tales of redemption can span all different genres and can be the result of any number of catalyst events . so the title of said essays could be varied .
not an auto before e ?	ye i forgot but then again they 'll be dead so it does n't really matter .
what has happened to k . irving ? he has gone from best cav , to around the 4th or 5th best cav .	injuries , man . his game was driving and quick cuts and using his quickness to get to the rim . with injuries to both legs , he just has floaters and catch and shoot to offer really .

the major wow servers . but google it yourself , and find a top list to see the biggest .	i did last night but i wanted reddit 's opinion on the subject . i wanted people who are actually here answering not statistics from a website that has n't been updated in a a year .

weird , i just assumed that they were using texas stuff to appeal to the other states . i do n't pay that much attention to car stuff , so that i can be complacent with my saturn sedan .	assuming that texas stuff could be used to appeal to the other states is a texan thing . i used to think those trucks were available everywhere , too .
high socks should be a requirement in baseball .	for real , some of these dudes look like they 're out there wearing sweatpants .
hell naw , this stays blue .	so do my eyes .

well , if you were addicted to it , then every time you finally start to reject it is a victory . its a step towards being completely free of your addiction .	so you are going to throw a party for every time a racist doesnt kill a member of a race he hates ? a party every time a priest doesnt have sex with children ?
ebonics is fascinating . we looked at it briefly in my linguistic anthropology class . it changed the way i looked at dialects and languages .	i would love to hear more about this . can you explain some or point at a good beginner - level resource ?

two things : she was pregnant during filming , so it is n't like she could be doing a bunch of stunts . and the aou black widow is still much better than the iron man 2 black widow .	i forgot she was pregnant ! now i 'm just imagining how a pregnant woman riding a motorcycle would have looked !
seriously . i only see blue and a brownish black . how the hell are people seeing white and gold ? no matter what i do i still see the same brown and blue .	i only see it as blue and black but i 'm also looking at it on a computer monitor so the image is surrounded by white . i 'm guessing people that see a white dress are looking at it on a phone .

i play shitty trombone , let 's make some brown notes as a trio	ditto over here , bass trombone too !
preventing ddos is entirely on the players , what could valve possibly do about it ?	one example ; valve , or the tournaments could provide a secure vpn for the players to access through when playing tournament matches .

beer delivery ?	north oak cliff beer and wine .

punch buggy ? the fuck planet are you from . it 's orange slug bug no slug backs .	he did n't pass the human test . must be some sort of pod or alien trying to pass for human .
i feel like this post is you not wanting to do the work of research .	actually this post is part of my work of research , dude , i have been googling for hours and asking in other places
i just dunk the onion in water immediately after i first cut it in half . seems to work fine for me .	my mom taught me something similar . i cut off both ends , top and bottom , then run the onion under cold water for a few seconds while i finish peeling it . never any tears .
i think the end was real . but the rest was n't . the girl kept almost laughing .	the end was what made me believe that it 's fake , i mean why would they post the video online and leave that part in ?
fucking boring .	office job ?
day z is a bad game .	what an extremely intresting life you must have , huh .
and no western team would have stood a chance against skt at that time either .	no western team has a chance to stand against skt right now either even with bengi being far past his prime .
i did n't expect england to win , but after some of the ref call , i 'm happy they did . come on ireland tomorrow !	thought the same . some intensity to that game , hope we can play like that tomorrow .
i dunno , the entire first half of the series was him and dan commenting how awful he was at the game . i think he knows he 's not good at it .	then why is he bothering to play it ?
i do . but this post is a bait trail of using extremists views to prove religion is bad , and you know that . if you do n't that 's the most amazing coincidence i 've seen today .	no its to show how extremists are bad . like i said , i 'm christian . if i was n't i would just ignore you and see how everyone else responds .
how do you not have room at your place for your gf ? actually , on second thought , no . do n't explain . i 'm sure it 's perfectly rational and made total sense at the time .	he 's renting a room in a share house and they do n't want an extra person . pretty normal situation
well yeah any girl i know would too ! the only reason i did n't include it was because the original situation was a male .	yeah , i figured . not trying to be a sjw or anything ! i would just hope she could empathize with him since he reacted pretty normally .
shower before bed instead of in the morning before work . you 'll sleep better and your sheets will stay clean longer .	and it will help prevent allergies if you 're allergic to dust and all the things that come off your skin at night .
the truck driver was a cunt . it 's a floating bridge , flying past in your fuckin 20 ton vehicle is going to cause problems .	the white car stalled and he drove to the front to pull it out of the way so the rest could pass . yeah it was drastic , but problem cleared . that 's russian mentality right there .
either you 're trolling , or you 're really too stupid to see what steele was trying to say . either way , i do n't see any reason to have a discussion with you .	do explain .
i feel like rand paul would be the best president america could have .	i feel the same , i was hoping that he 'd run this time around . he 's the only major party candidate who i 'd consider voting for in the presidential election .

what 's the difference between a large dildo and a joke ?	the joke is your penis and the other is the dildo .

your username is my favourite thing i 've seen tonight .	slow night ?
what is wrong with so many european girls home - life that they all wanna join isil ?	men with beards are sexy . which makes me think they should of dated hipsters .

it was seriously kind of weird driving through illinois recently and seeing a 70 mph speed limit on a road which , in wisconsin , would never be posted higher than 55 .	or all the roads with 55 mph speed limits that are blatantly ignored by everyone .
i thought we were in a democratic country ? why is n't this implemented ?	we are a representative democracy : we elect people to make our choices . we do n't make our choices ourselves .
so this is the real reason people buy it over phantom dancer .	it is cheaper and the burst from the proc will often make it do more damage in short trades . pd will scale harder as you go later into your build and provide a lot more sustained damage .
just gotta take it slow man . you fast one day the next day you 'll binge .	it 's less about whether you eat more following a fast , but whether you eat more than the calories that you did n't eat whilst fasting .
for what ? is him not dancing affecting anyone around him in any negative way ?	somebody is performing in front of you . put the fucking phone away and show some respect .

season 3 assassin meta was the most fun i 'll ever have watching and playing this game	also was worst meta to watch because first 15 minutes decided more then half the game .
there it is , a part of my childhood is officially dead .	and it was n't killed by the internet making porn of it .
it was n't planned ? because that 's a common thing . i let my mother and mother in law choose different dresses in the same color so their figures would both be flattered .	definitely not . and though they both looked lovely in the dress , the bride 's mother was short and white and the groom 's mother tall and black . there were some great photos .
he 's trying to process how his team gave up 18 runs .	no shit that game was painful .
get fouled by charlie adam or bitten by luis suarez .	i 'd rather tank a bite than get my shin shattered .
that song was already creepy . i felt insidious actually got less scary by using it because it felt too haunted house .	my only exposure to tiny tim was from spongebob , so i found him pretty harmless . after insidious , that song gave me chills .
serious question what would happen if a company said they did n't want to serve blacks or mexicans or something	any business should be able to refuse to sell their services to whoever the heck they want for whatever reason , imo . just as people have the right to take their money elsewhere .
i 'd assume yes since that 's literally the first thing you should aim to do on hardcore ironman lol	some people like to play without that . it adds to the thrill . no hardcore status , no account . gotta watch what you do at all times and not have that fallback option .
it hurts to admit it , but pat bev would fit your team perfectly and he 's a free agent this summer and would be relatively cheap .	rondo - beverly sign and trade ?
does this joke still work in the age of smartphone , where it literally takes 5 seconds to google something ?	ever heard of books ? they existed well before the internets . most people wo n't look it up , also if they did would n't that just add to the humor when they find out the real meaning ?

are we allowed to build the wooden house and upgrade it to stone ?	you can have 1 wood house and 1 stone house . so , if you build a wood house , and then upgrade it to stone , you ca n't have any other stone houses already . hopefully that makes sense .
pc players can be pretentious fucks . the xbox version will be fine , it will be bringing in more money for development .	so can console players . nice generalized statement though .
hey , hawks ! why do n't you pull your heads out of your asses and start playing like a playoff team . fuck the penguins .	we 're saving it for st louis , they 're about to lose their next 6 games against us so everything will be okay
the point is that it 's not a challenge from barnes . matic put his leg in the way . it was unfortunate and legs could have been broken but that was n't barnes fault .	nobody just raises their foot like that and leaves it in like he did . you can see he knows matic is going to win and leaves it high .
til when you 're black writing poetry , you 're a rapper . when you 're white in a rap battle you 're a poet .	it 's spoken word , which is typically categorized as poetry , regardless of your skin tone .
when the only people who can vote are white men who own land , the elections are even more openly reflective of ruling class interest than they are today .	or probably not far off considering the whole power of money in politics thing .
read his comments . not only are they unbelievable but there 's several i 'm not gay but posts . including the one about it 's not gay if they are taking female hormones .	no , read the one about cumming on birds or his sister shitting on his chest . the man is an artist of the finest caliber in making people sexually uncomfortable .
so why do you talk about ff at all if there is no skill in picking players ?	i talk about ff because i like to play . are you saying you talk about if because you have the skill to draft someone ? come on now
i was cheering for extra time .	same ! did n't want it to end ! one of the best matches i have seen in any league all season !
as a canadian citizen , i have never had any trouble from us border agents leaving my country , but my own border agents treat me like a criminal until proven innocent every . goddamn . time .	really ? it was the exact opposite for me as a us citizen . canada let us with no problems but us agents questioned us on the way back .
the us has a long history of using vaccination and other medical programs as cover for intelligence work . this is the result . they 've turned aid workers into targets .	bull fucking shit . they were attacking aid workers long before we nailed their hero osama .
get more bikes . its not a wife , you can have a harem .	this is my plan . only have the one right now , but based on what i intend to do on two wheels i 'ma need like at least five more bikes . someday .
would n't it kind of depend where the sun is in the sky ?	it 's set up so no matter what angle the sub hits the roof , it 's always hitting the opponents until about 6 : 30 ish
hopefully my nf players this game go better than walker and gray . got me shit all points last game .	i had gi cruising for a big total before the concussion . fucking hell .
no , the shot goes through the terrorist , killing him , and hits the terrorist he was originally shooting at , killing him also . hence , double kill .	so you are putting into consideration that they were still both alive , got it

citizens of dubai live like kings off the backs of foreign laborers who are basically treated like animals . it 's a fucked up system .	sometimes foreign laborers look like lions .
i - think - i sent it . hope you enjoy .	feeling better already ! lol
i 'm a dude . i 'm wearing skinny jeans . i regret nothing .	i love guys in skinny jeans .
the karambit is suppose to be a small concealed knife for sneak attacks . the m9 is a pretty good size with about a 5 in blade	actually the huntsman irl has an eleven inch blade , iirc .
messi for sure . one of his great qualities is his lack of diving , not arguing with the referee and playing fairly . yes , i 'm biased but it 's true	he 'd score with his hand if he could . in fact , he has already !
i agree , but to avoid them use all server locations i do n't play against mixed teams often .	it actually can do completely the opposite , as there only needs to be one player in us with a longer queue to take x amount of players from other regions into his mixed battle .
oh i 'll smoke em lol , i 'm just concerned as to why they 're hard , but it sounds like everyone has that experience so i guess that 's just the way they are !	off the top of my head , jericho hill uses the same wrapper and was also pretty stiff
little did chara know , three years after that hit , it would be pacioretty ripping the series winner past rask after he fucked up .	on the other hand , we lost in game seven against them that year and god know we could use patch in that serie , and big z was lifting the cup one month and a half later
even the gangs are aware of public relations .	i mean hell , the taliban has a social media department .
because my furry fetish eventually became routine . needed more and more extreme stuff .	so do you have sexual relationships with animals or just enjoy watching it ?
imo this is the worst rule ever for monopoly . it makes an already heavily luck based game even more luck based . whomever wins that early on is at a huge advantage .	it truly is . my family had this house rule for as long as i could remember , until i heard on reddit that it drags the game out . we started playing without it and never looked back .
how tall is he ? bulk up , bro . he 's fucking tiny	everyone is assuming i 'm a guy .
i agree with you , putin is trying to confuse the usa even more now by seemingly trying to stage another proxy conflict in the middle east in order to take attention off of ukraine .	why would putin need to cause a proxy war in middle east , the us can do that without his help
but those formats are flooded with old cards or at the very least balanced between old and new . what you said is n't the case irl	modern was basically broken by khans . dig and cruise immediately went into every blue deck . it just depends on the cards
football is all about the controversial decisions etc , it is n't ridiculed by shit reviews or stoppage shit .	it absolutely is ridiculed for both of those things . why do you think they implemented goal line technology ? because , surprise surprise , being correct is better than being wrong .
you can if you spam the market a bit . i 've seen quite a number of if hulks , lewa , bolasie , etc in the las few days .	you completely missed my point , i shouldnt have to sit there and spam the market i should just be able to buy and use the players i want .
from the way they are talking about structure changes , i think this will be a very slow , gradual process . so i think it 's far too soon to answer those questions .	it seems to me like the idea is for mediums to take the place of current pos 'when this happens
being able to write a single word in polish is already a contest itself .	at least they are read the same as they are written .
that 's not true , they also spam fair .	fair spam is stylish though , when they get three or four in a row in a string , it 's pretty cool
sega is still in business ?	yes and they are one of the few publishers who have dropped consoles all together to focus on the pc market .
thoughts on this ? i do n't think valencia is really super - utility , i do n't think his defence will be on par with pompey 's . though an extra bat in the lineup is nice .	tuning into the game late , so not sure if they said anything about it . could pompey have injured himself on that diving catch from yesterday ? he was rubbing his neck after it .
fighting off an infection takes more calories than not having bacteria grow on you to eat . frugal math 101 .	but infections attract so much food without having to travel . i 'm so confused .
how was justice denied ? the kid was sitting in the court room when his lawyer presented his admission of guilt . that 's precisely justice being served .	an innocent boy is being sent to his death over a crime he did n't commit . where 's the justice in that
the devil in the white city .	i know your not calling chicago the white city .
what are some examples of effective ways to expand an individuals vocabulary ?	read a dictionary til 'your eyes bleed . read books . all writers read . if you find a word or a phrase you really like , write it down .
if you get hit by aa blast and you are with agi treads , should you switch to str ?	no do not change your str stat at all . it is always best to keep your str stat exactly where is it . would you like the maths behind it ?
bloody hell i never realised how big new zealand actually was 0 - o	hmm . i had the opposite reaction . i thought it was double the size or more .
upvote because it made me chuckle . i have n't a clue but i imagine it would be fine , skateboard trucks are fairly tough	i 'm not concerned about trucks . i just want to know if it would be worth doing . wood being soft and stuff , it might get fucked up too fast
dude did you even read the post ? the dad is a psycho . read before you comment .	read my comment , i said besides all the other bullshit . his whole post reads of some massive insecurity about this guy .
good game ! you made some really solid plays there !	thanks ! sorry for the unusually long match . gg !
erron black being sonya 's dad sounds semi - plausible	it would be cool , but i have a hard time seeing it being true , like a few things in this theory . he seems way too young to have an adult granddaughter .
i prefer putting a bunch of ping pong balls in the cabinet and carefully closing the door .	put a filter in the sink and get ball bearings .
not to be a downer but idk if i 'm feeling this . i means it 's not really hip hop is it ?	i 'm feeling it but i really hope he raps on the album too . one 808s is enough .
there is most likely one or two doors hidden here , but still looks funny .	yeah there was a hidden door . i found it really easily , but thought that this was quite funny .
you would probably claw your eyes out at the boredom of the routine .	it takes an organized person to stick to a routine ! i would love to be organized and on time for once
as a man in a wheelchair , i 've noticed this . anybody else want a pro wheelchair game ?	iirc , you can play as a guy a wheelchair in tony hawks underground 2
wait , how can the joysticks fit under there ? do they , like , fold flat ?	they flip upside - down and the handles of the joysticks poke down through holes the desk . you do n't see them unless you have your head under the desk .
since when the fuck was nova useless ? i remember her picked every game and could 1v5	go play the game more before posting retarded shit .
show raw and smackdown live on the network . just sell ad time through there like hulu does on its site .	i 'm assuming the reason they do n't air right away is due to some sort of deal with whatever tv network they are dealing with . but seriously . come on .
for real though , he saved my life on the titanic .	really ? god bless that little retarded boy .
op sounds like an uptight cunt .	haha , sounds like she needs something in her cunt and she would n't be such a cock block !
there 's really no reason to keep it strapped other than for convenience . there usually is n't a premium on the buy back for a strapped box .	so there would be an expectation of an inspection of contents on transfer . that was the answer i was looking for . thank you .
came in to see if anyone else noticed the resemblance . like a twin sister .	i know what you mean to say , but you should know that mixed gender twins are always fraternal - they look no more alike than any other pair of siblings .
i was more distracted with the fact that the kid took off his shorts to reveal another pair of shorts .	when i was still in high school , almost every kid in weight training did that for some reason .
then why live in fucking illinois ?	some of us were unfortunately born in these hellish places .
call the number on those mobile billboards .	they have you phone numbers right on the strip . listen for the clicks , call the chicks .
then i guess my next question would be is there anywhere i can find pictures of houses in certain areas ? or less popular buildings ?	what area are you talking about ? do you want to see an area before you rent ? what 's going on ?
eh , i think lebron turning the ball over about a million times cost us the game . he played sloppy as hell .	he was also doing everything . i thought he was awesome fighting for boards and position down low . he had to play more like a 4 .
try going low on all settings , dont change resolution tho . and also change all the settings to the lowest possible in the nvidia control panel .	you think that could be a solution ? cause i should be able to run high on cs : go easy .
hitting the jaw tends to spin the person 's head more than any other type of punch , usually leading to a nasty little concussion due to the brain impacting against the skull from the recoil .	got a concussion by being punched unexpectedly across the jaw just like this .
efficiency does n't work when half the runs are literally impossible to get the achievement on , and the others are just plain unlucky .	well that 's what i meant , efficient in the sense that you make the fastest steps you can until you see its not possible to happen , then just hit restart .
i stepped on a rake on the ground and it whipped up and smacked me in the face .	i did that one time when i was a kid , except , it was a hoe , not a rake .
so now the drivers are going to try to take that pit entry even faster and run risk of hitting the tire barrier .	a red flag due to an incident in the pit lane entrance would present some novel procedural issues .
greys are the total number of reddit accounts on april 1st minus the number of clicks .	those who have n't posted in this sub are not yet grey .
i like cormier but he was the opposite of a buddy of jon 's and he got beaten , why take advice from him ? maybe rumble knows what he 's doing .	yeah i agree . dc hated jones so much that i honestly think it affected his fighting ability . all that hate seems to result in a massive adrenaline dump come fight time .
idk why people put it in the back , its much safer in the front and usually more room	i ca n't fit my phone , keys , headphones , and my wallet in two small pockets .
unless device sets up a good vpn or idk plays on his neighbours internet : d	is that possible or should i put down some dollars on penta xd ? how possible would you say it would be for device to play this match ?
will the us fuck it up for good they might as well clean it up . instead us support terrorist state of saudi a - rabia	if iran had n't spent the last decade supplying ieds and a slew of other shit maybe we would have left iraqi in a better position . go figure
anyone know what program this guy is using ?	its ableton live , not pro tools .
is the voting age in the uk really 16 ?	no , it 's 18 , but you can register to vote from 16
i feel really bad though . how about the 3 eggs and the parent for 3 db ha mons ?	it 's all good . you gave me something to work with at least ! i would n't mind getting the mother too if you do n't really want it .
so basically he wants you fired from your job so you 're around more and will see his girlfriend more . he is a smart one .	he does n't think before he acts . he just sees red and acts on impulse .
all of them carry a purse . it still takes about five minutes to find the house key .	my wife 's purse is like a black hole .
omfg that 's incredible ! never thought of that .	yeah did n't realize it till i saw the i and the ! , blew my mind thanks
well this one is different as its implemented by blizzard as a full part of the game , also it might be because people did n't know about the others , iv never heard of them	also , there will probably be a ladder for archon mode , most players ignore any game mode where you ca n't play for rank points
i meant i 'd get two regular sized ones , which are accompanied by two little ones each , giving a total of 6 knives altogether .	one small knife , one blunt sharpening instrument , some of them now just come with the knife .
yeah ! i 'm going to take my sister there , she needs a night out . lets do it !	hey , so i 'm at gwar bar for karaoke for the first time . maybe i 'll see you there !
now i have n't played kass with the new change and i rarely played him before the change , but i think the nerf is nowhere near as big as many people seem to think , but we 'll see how it goes .	what do you mean ? they basically cut his mobility , his trademark ability in half . he 's not even that great a anti mage anymore
having any issues with that cpu ingame ? like view distance , population , etc .	ca n't really tell . but it 's not exactly that demanding but it could definitely run better .
i thought knife of never letting go was a stand alone and chaos walks started with another book ? knife of never letting go is an amazing book though .	nope , two more books that follow todd . can not recommend more . go go read em now
10 - 4 . like i said earlier . i could ask a few questions and tell if it really went off .	i doubt op knows . he was n't there during the incident and is hearing everything second hand
how does the weather look ? any chance of rain ?	yeah , it can always rain , especially in the afternoon . i can see some dark clouds in the distance from the track .
one of the episode descriptions talked about jon returning back to the wall . i guess his body could be returned , but i took it as jon wo n't be stabbed this episode .	are you talking about a future episode description ? that has n't come out yet ?
nope , he is also at the party earlier in the film , but leaves before the fighting begins	but he does have a conversation with cap that fills in what he 's been doing since the winter solider that i was happy to see .
sonnen has gone on record multiple times admitting bisping won that fight .	people always say this , but i 've only ever heard bisping say chael admitted he lost , if you could show me something of sonnen saying it i 'll happily admit i 'm wrong
where do u work ?	see edit to original post , i put our website in
i really need fox sports 1 added to the sports package .	nbc sports for hockey , soccer , f1 .
i know he is , and it 's absolutely foolish to think that if you ended the drug war that cartel violence would cease .	bullshit . the drug trade funds that violence . human trafficking is far smaller share of the black market . legalization would cripple the cartels
that 's the aperture no ? no way they have a sensor that 's bigger than half an inch in there , that probably would be a first and they would be talking about it .	my bad . got mixed up . not sure what the sensor size is then . it 's the same module as the note 4 so it 'd be the same there ?
i 'm having to scroll too far down on the nba front page to find the game threads . what 's up with that ? this is the playoffs .	i wish they were stickied during the game or something . i always have to sort by new to find them on alien blue
16 years , man . best song this year .	not my favourite but not bad either .
yeah i ended up checking lids when someone mentioned them elsewhere , but op 's post linked adidas iirc	yea i went there first . i 'm waiting for a player jersey .
thanks ! we started last night with captain america and iron man , then we 've done iron man 2 and thor today with a few one shot shorts in between .	i 've always wanted to do something like that . next opportunity is the star wars movie .
that may be so but it sure seems like a lot of unarmed people are killed by police every year .	since the tray von martin case , the media has made sure to put every case of a white cop killing a black unarmed man . how many is that now since trayvon ? 5 or 6 ? we have a real epidemic here .
cm punk no more really depresses me for some reason . i can kinda picture it happening in real life . that being said , brock vs . bryan was the lulz . the art style really made it work well .	its probably a bit of a melodramatic representation of the reality , but it sure does sum up how it feels as a fan of punk 's , seeing him hang it up for good .
photoshop ? paint . net ? also , what language ?	english to spanish i will took a look to those programs , thanks !
looks interesting . anyone have a say about this game ?	i liked the story , thought the narrative was interesting . it 's difficult , but that 's kind of the point . worth 2 bucks in my opinion
you old boss sounds nice .	i only worked for them temporarily but it was a nice family all around and their one full time household employee was cool too .
played by john cusack in the movie .	a beautiful and tragic scene .
the cab driver is under no obligation to prove a government order to you , to my knowledge . google is your friend .	or the cities website , sometimes you have to look and not be an arse , op .
yeah , i mean your getting an almost rda experience out of a tank , you ca n't get big clouds without vaping a lot of juice . comes with the territory .	exactly , my atlantis is n't too bad . i miss the days of using twist batteries where i tank would last days
i was thinking that last night . how do you even stop that ?	you do n't . you can only hope to contain it .
ive never had a job interview where i was asked to see my phone . career centers can help you find a job without a phone . this is silly .	yeah and how did you arrange the interview ? how did you find out that you got the job ? good luck getting a job without a permanent phone number .
well , i thought it 'd be cool to share since the stream will be hard to find tomorrow . the message ultimately adds value to the community .	i agree ; just thought they should know
yeah i super dig it . just put it on a mix to send out , haha . i do not know how to make those well .	i 'm really good at them , it 's just i have to really trust someone or want to expose them to a new world musically in order to do it . i love exposing people to new , good music .
this is happening to more people and more people , i hope its cause of the wrong address	you need to get the link from the reddit sidebar and then bookmark it to make sure you do n't go to the wrong one . it was an expensive lesson learned in the sr days
inside of your forearm would work , but if you do n't want it there it could go on the top of your thigh . that 's where i would put something like that . it 's also a really cool idea !	thanks ! i was thinking maybe forearm or wrist . i have scrawny little arms , though , so i 'll definitely have to sharpie it on first to see if i like it .
you have hands ?	silly human . i have telekinesis .
right now it seems everybody is on a david kim love train , but in a week it 'll probably be forgotten and everybody will start hating him again , which is really sad imo	fuckin lasers , man . honestly the hate and love are part of the job that puts you in front of a lot of people in public . it sucks , but its just the way it is .
post this story on twox , and change op to female talking about an old man who touched her lady bits and a boyfriend laughing at her story and the comments in this thread are radically different .	you should change the old man to old woman , as well , then .
my pc almost crashed and i run ac : unity 0 . o	ran almost flawlessly on my note 3 o . o
oh yeah it does ! it is really awesome for the first few days as you ride to school , and everybody is looking at it and asking about it . makes you feel like a badass .	was a rush for me because i rode dirt bikes on the street illegally forever then one day - poof ! - its legal !
ho ho holy shit you are a dumbass .	i am too , for taking several minutes to understand your post .
there is a fixed amount of wealth to have ? intriguing .	as there is n't an infinite amount of money in the world , yes .
saudi women do n't drive therefore they do n't get raped therefore no need for a law .	they do n't get rapped when their car breaks down because they are chained to seven other chicks in her master i mean husbands basement .
as a new dude , the stoner question . who is it ? is it anyone ?	definitely a non answer . geoff might have been implying that he himself smokes . no one at rt openly smokes pot .
for real , what the hell happened to him ? he destroyed chicago a year ago in the playoffs .	that was the best 5 game stretch he ever had with the wiz . in the next series vs indy he played like trash when we needed him to at least play david west to a stalemate
would it be more funny to call her elizabeth in the setup , or just confusing ?	confusing , betty is a rarer nickname for elizabeth nowadays . it 's more likely lizzy .
why not put the scrubs in with like 10 mins to play at least ? this college basketball ritual is so fucking dumb	cal uses the time too work on other things kind of like a scrimmage when we are up this big . he has done this all year when we were up 30 .
yeah , i read that it 's ps plus only , so that kind of sucks . ill get the demo and see . sounds kind of like gta online as far as earning stuff as you go .	could compare , but do n't . open world , exploration , play based level system . yea , similar , i guess . check out the demo .
oh , wtf . that was completely unnecessary of your dad .	he 's not my dad . my dad was a wonderful man . this asshole is my step - dad .
was anyone else disappointed by the final fight ? from a story standpoint , it was fine , but visually , it gave me flashbacks to schumacher batman with the colors and the shot composition .	you 're not alone . seemed like a really weird direction to take it compared to the rest of the series
thanks , i 'd been avoiding it due to all the bad feedback . i 'd initially wanted to see it . now i 'll give it a go !	i completely forgot to return it to redbox , and i 'm not upset at all .
hat losing his spaghetti is just stress he 'll probably chill the fuck out on vacation	yup . the dropping grades is a good sign this place is taking too much of his time . its not healthy .
i found the smiley with the mouth first disturbing . am i the only one ?	that 'not a smile , it 's an asian hat
i 'm pretty sure spain and morocco were both given misinterpreted surveys which means the results are in fact opposite what is represented .	i sure hope so ! although i do enjoy moroccan food so if they do truly fair better then the us i know i can keep them on my possible asylum list if rick santorum ever gets elected .
i really do n't care .	cool , keep us posted if you change your mind .
i 've played a lot of gwent and never had any problems . has this happened to other people ?	crashed the game first time i played and passed . i have n't played since .
i agree . and if we put them together that means we have one legitimate line that can score and a bunch of makeshift lines with the scoring threat of a third .	i think the way the third and fourth lines played thursday night would allow them to play together . rangers would n't be able to stop that line very easily .
does that chair have a face ? because i see a face . and that kitten is adorable !	creepy cat face in the pillow .
yeah , i got down - voted then up - voted and then down - voted like crazy but hey i 'm just glad its solved and over with . i 'm more than likely done selling on here .	sorry you had an awful experience , if you have anything you still want to sell i 'm more than happy to do business with you .
nhl hut does have happy hours with double coins . they constantly give out free packs too , ea is n't as bad with other games as they are with fifa	except you ca n't see the opposite team or the latency bar .
fuck i 'm gold .	most of my university students i teach were n't born when jurassic park came out . realizing that made me feel old .
why do you feel the need to mention that they have better pcs . that 's not the reason they are better then you .	sometime it is . if you get fps drops from time to time , or just random freezes .
i think it might be me . i had a dream last night that i was eating myself while in line at the bank . i do n't even think i was hungry , just bored .	as long as you do n't act it out . i think your still pretty sane . but i 'll keep an eye out on the news just incase
china has even lower fertility rates or at best comparable with japan .	because they are controlling it . if it were n't it were more similar to india

i can totally see where gabe 's coming from too . but whenever he explains the purpose behind monetizing mods he gets downvoted to hell . not even lord gaben is safe from the hive mind .	thats what i find nuts , gaben is like reddit 's messiah , or one of them , and yet even he cant cut through the rabble
if you do n't have time to sleep extra in the night , than try to make room for a 20 minute nap every noon .	ok , i will . can you help me with the school problem though ?
i just do n't see what the subtitle argument has to do with remaking foreign shows into english .	so you are saying that they should simply import foreign shows and dub them ? i guess that could work . though personally , i prefer to listen the original language and read subtitles .

he was never part of tim 's master plan .	who do you think will be a running candidate for your team next season ?
i literally played only an hour or 2 in cbt for this reason exactly . your comment shows the problem they 'll be facing now .	i did the same thing . i played for a couple of hours and now waiting until release so i do n't get burnt out . i like the game and ca n't wait .
loki was developed villain by the time avengers cane around . he got zero development in the avengers . he was worse than ultron imo .	loki 's development is what is n't seen . he goes from a trickster to a villian . he 's seen some shit .
why would that guy bring so much food though ? that 's a lot of food for supposedly two people out for a day .	well , they were following them . if they were doing real recon , it 'd take a while .
have you called a lawyer and gotten that thing out of your home ?	no to both questions . i ca n't lift the thing by myself so i 'm going to have a friend help me move it to the garage tonight . what kind of lawyer should i call ?
at tax payer expense .	yup . and its a waste of money . if the death penalty is n't used how its suppose to then do n't have it at all .
or diamond armor . also does steven still have that black eye ?	the black eye could probably be another thing to make her look scared .
how many hours a day do you meditate ?	i 'd say i do seated meditation for about a half - hour a day . but i do n't really time it and i 'm not super disciplined about it . i also do n't think it has anything to do with zen .
but punks are proud to be punks . the problem is nobody is a hipster if you ask them . its a weird balancing act of trying to be cool but not act like you 're falling into what 's popular	part of being a hipster is being too fucking avant garde to be classified .
what parts are you looking for ? i have the same case in red just lying around its also missing many bits but it might have what your looking for .	a front fan mount and 2 short thumb screws . but really any parts will probably come in handy .

what 's that ? i ca n't hear anyone over the roar of my 1967 cadillac el dorado convertible !	i 'll carve off what i want , and ride the rest home !
depends which country youre in i would assume . here in australia our sewage system isnt shit like america so we can flush all sorts of crap down and it doesnt block up	it does n't block , it just ends up on the beaches . unless your country has some sort of magical sewage vanishing spell , it does not depend on the country .
cool , proof received !	thanks , hope everything is good !
what do you think would happen to you and your life if you completely stopped meditating ? what would change ?	i ca n't even fathom it . i would n't be the same person .
are you genuinely trying to argue that a change of government will have no impact on people 's lives ?	just wondering precisely what changed in your life exactly . what quantifiable things can you demonstrate to have happened ?
i would buy hyouka even if it were one of the slightly over - priced limited run releases that sometimes comes stateside . i would also never say no to a translated set of the light novels .	hyouka 's actually a set of full length novels which makes it sound even better .
personally , i think evangelion is a little overrated . i mean , it 's a really good show , but i do n't see what makes it one of the best of all time .	that 's just my opinion . i could write a 1000 word essay on why i think it was the best , but it probably would n't change any opinions .
it 's so good to see so many 12s cry around me . their sadness and depression feeds my life force .	my facebook is great right now . so many seahawk fans crying .
wait until it 's not the middle of the night for europe and usa .	lol that makes sense , but unfortunately i have school and work , so i was hoping that would n't have to be my solution : p

i think the word is mainly a dan brown construct .	as if your first post did n't make me feel bad enough ! ha .
no worries , this challenge is n't one of my best . hopefully i 'll come up with something new . btw could you try my maverick on high and see if the car drives ok .	still tips a little . and does n't steer after 80 mph . pretty much everything in the description holds true . on a side note , i love it . it 's so fun to play with
that 's good to hear ! i 'll take a ghost over a crazy hobo any day !	definitely . and i 'd much rather some sort of ethereal ghost candle than an actual hobo playing with fire in my very - much - made - of - wood - everything - is - wood house .
it would be a shame if a molotov cocktail just happened to land in her house while another landed under her car .	that 's a bit much , i 'd probably just throw a brick every once in awhile .
note : i am the author of this piece . if you think this is a breach of etiquette please let me know . this is also a good place to provide feedback and corrections if needed .	shill . but , seriously , it should be fine . we have had other authors post their pieces in the past , and your prior ones were all solid . reading time .

he knows what he did wrong . he 's just figuring out how she found out . good on you though op . hope you do n't get nailed for that .	at this point , i 'm not sure i would care if he did find out it was me . he knows its wrong to act like that , and i called him out on it .
ricky , shut up	fuck off cyrus .
first thing i noticed . it was in the first line .	are you trying to claim you read the first line first ? lol .
use the search bar please . there has been multiple people asking in the past month .	i just searched for someone with a problem such as mine and found nothing .
if i 'm going to dox someone i 'm not going to get caught . if you think i dox people go ahead , i do n't really care at this point .	i do n't care if you do or do n't , either way you 're an extremely shitty person . fuck dude , i was even being nice to you that day on kohi but you kept calling me shit .
the ratios is closer to 60 - 40 . but my guess is that women no matter how fat or skinny can go out and have sex when ever they want . it 's not so with men .	having a lot of sex does n't make you any less lonely . trust me .
i inherited this rifle from my grandfather . the stock and forearm were damaged but i was able to find replacements . it is chambered in 35 rem and was made in 1946 .	awesome gun in a great caliber .
it ca n't hurry and get here . i ca n't even celebrate our championship on here . we let ohio state celebrate without down voting them to hell	it seems like the evil empires in college football are n't hated quite as much as in college basketball

do you routinely have a second person on hand to help manage the cables ?	having someone handle cables is standard for 1st time use . trying it out alone after that is easier once you know how the system works .
you , friend , are a water waster .	maybe you should stop drinking water to make up for him .
moon , interstellar , mad max : fury road , kingsman : the secret service and inception are the 5 most important movies of all time .	i think you 're forgetting fight club .
sleeping on the floor or a hard mattress is the bomb . how people can enjoy those super squishy traps is so strange to me .	4 in memory foam on the floor . my husband and i have been known to take it on our screened porch and sleep out there for a while . the best .
well it 's not how english works where everyone else on this sub lives .	i did n't know we had so many people from non english speaking locations on the sub .

this . no educated ob would raise an eyebrow at a 50 pound lift when she 's been maintaining throughout . she 'll have an easier labor and delivery , i 'd bet !	she is n't just lifting it . she is swinging it with no control . one wrong move and the baby could be seriously harmed . they 're are a myriad of other ways to exercise when pregnant .
i have no boxing experience but i will fight him for a big pay check and then i will show him how to do right with that money .	you could die boxing him .
dream theater .	everyone i know who likes dream theater says dream theater is the only good band and it 's really fucking annoying .
obviously . that 's why resident evil is in the spot it is now putting out shit games like resident evil 5 and resident evil 6 .	i liked 5 . not as a resident evil game , but just as a coop game on it 's own . 6 was just garbage on the other hand .
as a super noob , thank you for speaking a language i can understand . i 'm super interested but this stuff is intimidating .	it 's cool , i spent a lot of time making sure i was n't talking bs xd
i have always been the guy who just tanks the damage an keeps going . as a result i have learned how to survive at high damages .	that does n't work in a highly competitive environment where you should be trying your best to not take damage at all
yep , next season bane will break oliver 's back .	slade is oliver 's bane . but he wants to put an arrow through oliver 's eye instead , so who knows . maybe one day we 'll have eyepatch ollie .
tell me about it . i did n't bowl all that well and neither did my father .	i guess you could say , that your uncle bowled over
i do n't think it matters . if you think it matters , i 'm curious to know why you think my gender matters . this could make an interesting conversation .	it 's because of the whole joke of how men can think about nothing , and most women ca n't . was n't being serious ya butt
i agree , a lot of the devil fruit powers are really cool . robin 's is badass .	yes , robin 's devil fruit is on my opinion the best .

how much did these cost ? nice	i paid 300 cad .
where do i get the crossbow . i 'm still in the first area , trying to fight the griffin , except its going to probably be a while before i mess with the griffin lol .	you should get it just before you go and attack the griffin .
who the fuck cares , your computer 's also come with minesweeper and solitaire among other games .	yeah but those are actually fun and do n't take up a lot of storage
yeah . unsubbed accounts are now veteran accounts that act like starter . so you can log on and play toons under up to 20	can those account receive mail if i wanted to send gold from an active account to an inactive account ?
would you mind opening this soda can for me ?	no i dont mind , pass it over lol .
he got dragged down by horford right there . he and korver both went for the ball in game 2 . only blatant thing he 's done is leg lock taj last round	even the taj thing was n't a dirty play in the sense that he was trying to hurt someone . if taj did n't react it would 've been a non - issue .
it 's okay , i freeze my ass off in 30 degree weather . i 'm too afraid to drive in ice as well !	we have winter tires for the ice . plus you can drift the corners with the handbrake . what 's not to love .
it 's not going to be worth it unless they have high heels .	did you finally find a use for all those shoes in eve ?
how is it misogynistic to want to protect the lives of unborn women ?	not everyone agrees that early term fetuses count as unborn people . how many cells do you think it has to get to in order to become a person ?
should be a good game , even without dmac you guys are putting together one heck of a dream team .	we cut and traded all of our players , signed a 30 year old rb and a cornerback . what have we put together ?
that 's good advice but i would have no idea where to look and i feel like that would be awkward at times too . i 'm not sure lol	i was thinking about making an okcupid account for it , there is an option to check for people looking for friends but idk how well that would go .

i wonder how people of mixed race fit into this .	we just hate everyone .
this . i joined a site for like , three days and realized how terrible and segregated it made me feel compared to other dating sites . do n't be cruel to yourself . hugs	same here . and then it took some serious work to get them to delete my profile .
bump to the question for the offline installer , or where to find the installer that the executable downloads prior to installation from the link above !	please , please , please can someone post an offline installer for the old version . i lost it when i rebuilt my computer and did n't realise the new version was so awful ! thanks .
i thought that too , but it looks less dangerous when you are on site .	i . e . on shore ? because from the water those stairs look like an accident waiting to happen .
is having an open relationship with your wife a possibility ? if not maybe you should just break it off .	i want to do it right , not open . wife would never go for that . she acknowledges she does n't want to work very hard in the marriage . very laid back person . very nice though .
i know that feeling . hope you got satisfaction from finally working it out .	well it made the internet 's collective pants get pretty tight for a moment there , apparently , so i guess i 'm pretty happy with the result .
i 'm entirely neutral on opie . i recognize his faults , but they do n't bug me . i dislike anthony because his show fucking stinks , and his victim mentality grows by the day .	you just make up some random bullshit and jam it on the internet ? go listen to opie chew into the mic , dumb dumb .
how did you end up in poverty ?	born in it . went to college poor . couldnt afford to eventually dropped out . have student loans i ca n't pay of in default .
unless i saw the replay wrong , it looked like the 6 stayed put in the middle lane and the 41 drifted up . but who knows .	it was all air 27 being high took it off the right side , 41 looking low took all the rest off . all air .
dogs . holy shit me and dogs have a special bond i swear	i got a dog too . you just have this special bonding .
maybe you have that opinion since you 've never seen it , but plenty of people have seen animals slaughtered and then eaten them that day . it does n't bother you as much as you think it would .	i have seen it . i lived on a farm with my mom for 2 years or so , and i always refused the meat . it makes me sick just thinking about it .
she 's proof that an overall beautiful face and an overall beautiful form overrides everything else , appearance - wise .	yup . and no amount of makeup and cutesy myspace angles will make a ham into a hepburn . ca n't look naturally beautiful if your natural looks is all covered in fat .
because of how easy it is to identify things on long island south shore , i can actually see what town i live in on this map . pretty cool .	in that case , i 'll ask you : what 's that green bit on the southwest of long island ?
been playing since original red and blue , have played every single pokemon handheld to date , have sunken countless hours in these games , i have never seen a shiny pokemon in my life	i had a shiny squirtle and did n't even know it until a friend pointed it out .
paul blart : mall cat	cat blart : meow cop
does he live in this glass or does he have a proper tank ?	he has a proper tank . this is just the cup he came home in .
i thought maybe there was an explanation for it , but yeah , i guess we have to watch the finale .	to answer your question , in the comics he can use the cosmic treadmill 'to travel time accurately .

happy edc !	it 's my birthday too !

these puns are so bad they just left me cold .	i feel like this comment thread has n't even scraped the tip of the iceberg .
you pretty much read my mind with the stand up nights and game rentals . i want to get a bong rental shelf but first i want a better ventilation system	damn , some friends and i were talking about doing this exact thing , but unfortunately , marijuana has yet to be legalized here .
plenty of competition in ogn and lpl by itself , watching lcs is like watching the d league compared to the nba , but i do it because the local team is in it .	so let me rephrase , you dont like international even competition ?
even video games ? what the fuck is wrong with you ?	i really do n't get into video games . i can see how other people love it , and i use to play , but it 's not for me .
the entrance is silent , but you can see a few pairs of feet underneath the door . you assume they 've posted guards at your room .	i scream at own ass .
bsb i 'd imagine is for exercise , etc , but when do you swap between the ll and the lb ?	cuz i do n't want the link band to get over used you know ? i 'm 24 , go to university , party with friends and all that . i wanted a nicer casual band . and yes sport is for my gym time lol
this . if you really want to cheese your way through souls games , magic is the way to go . with melee weapons , pve is never truly a joke . it still takes a lot of skill to never die .	until you start the dlc and everything is resistant .
okay ! single handedly downvoting all my comments , genius move !	this can stop as soon as you shut up and move on .
love paul robertson .	his name is robert paulson .
i have a beagle . his food is n't eaten , it 's inhaled .	i had to switch my lab to smaller bite food , since she does n't take time to chew .
i like a big nose on girls .	i was about to say this . i do n't know why but it always looks so nice .
well , it 's probably exhausting as fuck to be in charge of everything , as a ceo	at least valve does n't function like any other company . there are no bosses . everyone decides on what they want to work on , hence the desks having wheels to move about via elevator .
oh yes that describes him well , except for the not stupid part . he manages to be both stupid and aggressively lazy .	he seems pretty good at refusing work without saying it . what does he do that 's stupid but not carefully designed to end with him doing nothing ?
there 's is a difference between intelligence and knowledge , which are often terms used interchangeably . knowledge is the difference between us and then , not intelligence .	knowledge is knowing that a tomato is technically a fruit . intelligence is knowing not to put tomatoes in a fruit salad .
millions of usd worth of transactions are occurring every week . that counts as being used to me .	yea . i just move them off exchange and back on it . does n't count .
it 's more trying to keep balance . some of us hate being lied to , that 's all . some people do n't mind being fed shit all day , every day . and that 's o . k too .	i have no strong feelings one way or the other about this post .
i dislike him for his actions and mentioned nothing about his music . that being said , if the song in the video is good evidence of his talents then yes , i hate that , too .	i can dig his new music . it 's pretty good .
you 've spent thousands of real dollars on all those licenses and any profit you made became steam money . i hope you kept the receipt for your extra chromosome .	this was my first thought as well , if he is legitimate he is valves wet dream
could it be the strain ? i recently bought a quarter ounce of blue dream so that 's all we 've been smoking . and i always have soothing chill music on because i enjoy that .	if he 's inexperienced it could be the blue dream . that is pretty strong for a light smoker .
this is what cities like baltimore should do when thugs start rioting . the rest of the community should come together and protect the community and property .	you ca n't really compare a homogenous nation like estonia to a multi - racial city like baltimore .
who made them . i did n't see it on the roast , but i skipped snoop dog .	they cut the jokes , but jeff ross , natasha and that new snl guy
i 'm gonna be honest , i was n't a fan the one and only time that i had it . but you have me intrigued , is it worth another chance to age it ?	i think it 's worth it to age this beer , it 's so potent that after several years it turns into brandy .
is it your phone , or the companies ?	company , but home wifi .
because i carry concealed everywhere i go - sign or no sign . i care more about my ability to defend myself than about some stupid sign . that , and if it 's concealed , who is going to know ?	ah , your rights are more important than everyone else 's rights . got it !
the privacy of the individual is more important than justice apparently . but i think merely having it , and making the judge aware , may make the difference .	that 's total bs . at least in the us , 1 or 2 party consent for recording only applies when there is an expectation of privacy , which is definitely not present when driving .
i 'll second that emotion .	but can i borrow a feeling ?
just goes to show islam is not the problem , religion and a lack of critical reasoning in all forms is the problem .	actually after reading the article i 'd say islam is the problem , based on the article isis would be considered true islam followers based in teachings from the koran .
my question is , why are n't you playing counter strike ?	i play cs too man . much better game .
judith is trying to learn to crawl . this pleases me .	honestly , i suspect most of her work is improv . i bet she does n't even read the script . she 's very good .
just wait for a sale if you 're that desperate to save money . why cheat a system that 's more than fair ?	i do n't do it , i was just explaining why people do it . and if they are willing to go through that much hassle to buy it cheaper , they probably do n't want to wait for a sale .
lol it 's funny how you think regular conquest is anything but casual .	i was referring to league , which is what normal conquest inevitably leads to . that itself leads to frustration . thus , i said stick to casuals . still confused ? go read a book .
the kitchen cabinets in my house make a distinct noise when they 're closed that does n't sound like anything else in the house .	do they make a distinct noise when opened as well ? is it common for you , or your parents to leave any of them open ?
i 'm a 48 if you can get around to helping me too . getting no responses in this area all night	i 'm right at the fog with bell chiming . dunno what 's up seems like barely getting responses here for hours . i have no password set so anyone should be able to find me . thanks
give me an hour to decide . most likely gonna be yes though	kk no rush .
i ordered one from them . it is still sitting in preorder status . i would really love to get my hands on one of these . i may break down and just pay the amazon premium price .	it 's weird that if you search for raspberry pi 2 it 's completely gone from their store .
refusing to believe that which you have no reason to believe , is not equivalent to faith .	i would say that believing in something you cannot prove is faith , whether it 's the supernatural or the definitive absence of the supernatural .
i 'm betting poor health . if she is seen in public in poor health it might hurt her haes business so she is just focusing online and trying to scam enough money to get by .	i 've bet hard on that myself .
what nature do you want it ?	ummm idk xd just pick one that gives me sp . att . does n't matter which one
how 're you guys making coffee ?	starbucks via packets are good too , pour a packet into a water bottle and you have instant iced coffee , or hot if you can get hot water .
i just read somewhere that it 's where you store your save data for the game . does that mean your progress is connected to your account and not your console ?	yes . you can load your game on another console and it will all be there
you 're clearly trolling . read a history book .	i think you are the one who needs to read a bit . give me a year in which the land was palestinian . it should n't be difficult , it 's just one number , right ?
is all of it an answer ?	i guess it is . : p
exactly . people suck at statistics . fatasses on diet soda , myself included , are already in a high risk group because they are fatasses .	yup . i 'm pretty much the opposite . i probably average about a liter of diet soda per day , and i also watch my caloric intake . i 've lost about 100lbs over the past 4 years .
do the cubs even have anyone in the system to replace him ? i wish they would talk about farm systems more during the game .	baez can theoretically play shortstop . addison russel is also a year or 2 away and he looks pretty good .
observation : you are a really negative person . suggestion : you should lighten the fuck up .	the man makes a valid point .
damn , that might be a bit too late since i 'm finnish and have to get to work tomorrow .	sorry man i guess you were trying to get them done b4 toty ends . if you still need them sometime this weekend we could prob work something out
i 've only played on pc , so that 's not true . i 'm saying i play with a controller on pc and i am able to walk . there 's probably a way to do it on keyboard too .	you can only walk with a controller because a joystick allows different levels of input , rather than a key on a keyboard which is either pressed or not .
i find this game to be really aggravating to watch . both team 's offense is pretty bad	on the other hand , there 's been some great defense tonight .
i play on zone . so i 'm confused . turn on zone hitting . change the input type to analog . then turn on the pci .	i 'll give this a shot next time i 'm on . thanks for the response !
jesus man , i 'm sorry you have to live like that .	me too , but shit happens , and everyone has something going on . insomnia just happens to be my greatest issue so far in my life , leagues above being trans .
computers are dumb but fast . people are smart but slow . coding is just translating complicated statements into a bunch stupidly simple commands .	i feel even more insignificant now . dammit , i 'm going to learn to write code .
awesome . but , i 'm kind of confused about what asking a statement is .	i hate when people talk like this ? is everything a question ? i should have used an example that is n't a question ? this is confusing to write ?
so your basicly talking about getting quality while not spending quality money .	more like getting a fantastic processor at a cheaper price . so yeah .
when something is clearly the smart and right decision , and yet people are still not doing it , then yeah i think it needs to be forced .	if you let other people decide for you what qualifies as a smart decision , you 're going to have a bad time . particularly if those other people are the government .
tobacco lawsuit has to do with loss of brand power , goodwill , trademark limitation by companies . nothing over the top ridiculous there .	exactly , they 're pissy because they 're going to lose money .

swan bay , manly . its got a cool rope swing and if you follow the path around theres about a 4 - 5m jump you can do off the cliff . go at high tide though	while they 're in manly , they can hit up the cove at red beach . just swim around the rocks to the north of the surf club . cliff ledge , tree and i do n't know if the rope is still there .
that 's why those baby on board signs are so stupid . how about if we all just drive safe for everyone 's sake .	they 're actually designed so if there 's a car accident rescue and safety crews know to look for a baby .
the population is still growing . we 'll eventually hit a point where earth simply ca n't sustain the numbers .	nope . not true at all . there 's reasons for space colonies , but that is n't one .
am i a prude for thinking this is stupid because kids might see ? i think public stuff can be hot , but not if kids are around .	yeah , i kinda agree with you . i think these ladies could face sex offender status for exposing themselves like this .
can you can slide down the notifications menu while holding the phone with one hand still ? if so , that 's impressive .	yes , i can , but not easily . i have to hold the bottom with my pinkie and stretch my thumb up to do it .

hey , your closer to the mountains than i am . driving 5 or more hours just to get to the border is ridiculous .	just count pine trees to pass the time : d
telegram is awesome !	i second the vote for telegram - a really reliable , fast app . the secret chats function is pretty cool , and stops copies from being saved on their servers if that is a deterrent .

i do n't think robin is a great manager by any means , but i do n't think he 's preventing them from winning . the problems with this organization goes well beyond him .	well he had single handedly cost us 2 games this year . he lacks leadership skills . has no regard for accountability . he 's just a bad manager and all the fault should fall on him .
venture bros comes to mind , although its a cartoon .	you 're right ! i totally re - created it as a live - action in my head !

if you already know what you want to play then you might not actually need this chart .	i was curious if the chart accurately predicted what i wanted to play . it correctly guessed that i want to play portal 2 and skyrim , but it did n't match me up with my favorite game , lol .
dice was n't even involved in the development of this game .	they were , they helped on a lot of the mp end of the game while visceral did most of the work . sort of like how dice helped moh in 2010 or whenever that game was .

per is a worthless joke stat . i do n't know what else to tell you . by per , draymond green is a below - average player . do i really need more of an argument than that ?	if you think pointing out one example of where a stat is inaccurate proves that it 's worthless , you have a very poor understanding of statistics .

it 's incredible , i have a few cases for the fridge . check out four fathers and 18th street .	wow , i 'll look for it tonight . have n't tried 18th st yet , though i heard their coconut beer was amazing ! i have n't even heard of four fathers yet . sooooo many new breweries !
agreed , his vocals on that performance are amazing . then again , so are nick 's . very marvin gaye vibe .	totally agree ! he needs to do a funk album to go with that funk voice
1 dab down , i request a viking funeral . place my body on a ship and burn it with the sea !	i 'll fire the arrow myself .
i just got mine for christmas ! love this especially in black and white like this . i also got a walker merle one as another christmas gift	agreed , the blood on the black and white makes for a nice contrast .
yup you can buy her now , or wait for some stupid chests	have n't seen tsm apollo in any chest so far though
he knows bronze , that 's good enough to beat tsm and clinch a 2nd spot behind c9	yeah that 's why tsm is top in the nalcs . while they did shitty at msi , you ca n't discredit their success at home .
omg you bitch if it 's too big , you complain now its too small . shut the fuck up , you people have no idea what you even want . this dude is like , perfect .	i was n't complaining about it at all , just thought it looked a bit strange . dude still has an incredible physique .
steven and connie 's journey on lion 's back .	it 's a pink cat and we 're sitting on him flying fast across the ocean lion he 's cat jesus he 's a pink fluffy cotton ball
is the camera really as bad as everyone says it is ?	it 's not a dslr , that 's for sure . as phone cameras go , it 's average .
i did , and it worked fine . but i see some images were taking longer to load , so it might have timed out on your end . but i fixed it .	loaded fine on my side !
deej 's feelings got hurt so he took his ball and went home , he does n't post here any more .	that was my point without being rude . his boss probably told him it 's better to fall silent than be misinterpreted . and that sucks for us .
we are definitely starting our bruising line - up	i just have a feeling both morata and tevez are going to find the back of the net today . edit : half right already ! edit 2 : prediction achieved !
if it 's going to be anything like the the last of us movie i suspect it 'll feature a inappropriately aged star from a hit tv show as snake .	neil patrick harris as solid snake . edit : good god people , you ca n't take a fucking joke .
i 'm not saying there 's a better alternative , just that the big o is a god damn awful stadium and i 'm not paying anymore to watch the impact play there .	i 've missed only one game at the o since we 're in the mls . i loved every single game i went to and am absolutely not missing next week 's .
i 'd tell you to pee in the stall but then there 's always the chance you 'll accidentally flush your dick down the toilet .	might even drop his spaghetti .
but the warm air will condense on the cold lock and create even more ice for the next time .	yeah do n't have to worry about that because if we are getting in them in this weather they are either coming inside or going flying .
if you 're offered a mint or gum take it .	this is law at a poker table . if you 're offered , it 's for a damn reason .
i did . wish i 'd waited until i got home . grown man broke down at his desk briefly at work lol . fuck that kid is strong .	dude same thing here . no more feels videos for me today . well at least until i get home .
i 'm not saying it 's fake , i do n't even care really . but there will always be people that lie on reddit , and there will always be people that do n't believe on reddit .	yeah , this is one of those things that might be real , might be fake , but it 's not important enough for me to find out for sure .
did you forget to bring the proper offering of cheeseburgers ?	arthur 's the kind of cat that would appreciate a cheeseburger , but would prefer some sort of ceremonial offering coupled with the souls of the dead . he 's a very angry cat !
it 's so refreshing to be playing a team that actually goes on cold streaks instead of scoring in every possible situation	yeah , it is hard to appreciate how good the spurs were in the moment until watching this game .
they do n't , in fact it only encourages them . they know it 's bothering you . so they 're going to escalate until they can get a reaction out of you .	yeah , with me , i did n't saw a solution , first ignored them , then saw that that did n't work and tried fighting back . only made things worse .
asking for a girl 's number is sexual harassment ?	pressing the issue when she turns it down is harassment .
my doc said there is n't anything to worry about for the most part . unless you are on serious stuff i would guess the same goes for you . pct does suck bad , but that could just be me .	thank you it 's nice to know i 'm not alone .
considering the flair , i doubt you can be unbiased in this situation . dude is dirty , but he 's dirty for you so you look the other way .	diving on the floor for a loose ball is n't dirty , it 's hustling . if korver had gotten on the floor for the ball rather than trying to lazily pick it up then he would n't have been injured .
it 's not if steam says the program is fine . i really do n't see what all you guys are finding problems with	they actually said it was fine ? then why not just give the cards when you buy the game if that 's so ?
randy 's fights in the baseball episode were great .	at the end when he starts singing the rocky song as he 's fighting bat dad lol .
awesome deck lol . if the goal was to make the whole deck pr cards , then why not use visual arts instead of king of fighters ?	because i 've always wanted to use ash . the va cards can stay in the va deck . in the end want to get a neo standard deck that does n't count as any of the series in the game .
that 's great , now how does it effect my balls ?	radiation from the laptop ? no ! at most , the heat of the battery might affect your sperm count if you had it directly on your balls for an absurd amount of time !
i 've seen that . lack of martell 's guide was why i thought its so hard play them . if it will eventually be there then i 'm really looking forward to it .	yeah , i 'm working on it now . the thing is that martell are a late game house , so opening strategy discussions are n't quite as useful a guide as for the other houses .
the free audiobook requires that you have a credit card , which i do not .	they 're amazon linked so if you have arrangements with amazon those will work too .
however her int and wis was high enough to successfully roll a 15 on accusing him .	that 'd be a cha check , would n't it ?
fuck it i 'm moving to canada	we 're happy to have you north of the border . your pre - canadian training is to watch the nhl playoffs and learn how hockey is played . it will help your immigration process .
did you get the red fleece stuff ? i wish i had gone to try them on because they are really nice shirts , just terrible fits for me .	yup , i bought one red fleece shirt too . its a little bit tighter but not that much
i am not sure about this but i think the directions api are n't free because you would be in direct competition with google .	i 'll just try to intercept the notifications and display them as text in my app then . do n't see a better solution .
yes , sir . been thinking about steroids but would i will probably wait til i 'm at least 30 - 35 . i want to see what i 'm fully capable of naturally .	nice man . great physique , especially for a natural
underrated song and tape . i have very fond memories of the couple of weeks after this came out	yeah i 'd play school high everyday for weeks it felt like .
probably not lager cool . just message me if you have any more questions .	nope , definitely not lager cool . i 'm excited to finally be able to brew year - round , brew lagers , and cold crash !
how the fuck is that red ?	you must be having a really bad day , if you need to hate on the color , while looking at a hottie .
argh ! stupid driver . i 'm glad you 're still having a good day ?	yeah did n't realize until this morning when i noticed a not under the wiper . she was sorry and left her info . no reason to get all upset .
awwww , well now i feel bad : c i 'm sorry ! while we do appreciate you doing them , it is sort of our duty to get them going . so no offense meant ! just mod stuff , y 'know ?	can i make a mid - game thread , so we can talk about the ice crew ?
low t is a serious issue .	i 'm sorry . i did n't mean to undermine it . but is it that hard to fix ? are there really bad side effects when it comes to that type of medication ?
in depth analysis - he grabbed the ledge .	what where ? how deep is this analysis of yours ?
well , i have a bunch of respect for gaga now . i guess crazy just gets the bills paid	i do n't like her antics and bizarre fashion , but damn that woman can sing .
no . because we did not win against arsenal . if we win this game , we win the league if we win against crystal palace this weekend .	would n't one win in the next two and an arsenal loss on monday clinch it as well ?
those are definitely computer generated in .	everything but the building on the left and the people is green - screen cgi 'd in .
count your calories , makes things very simple .	so , i can eat a tuna salad sandwich and still lose weight ?
do these bike lanes go to uh ? i have n't seen the around campus at all , but i may have missed them .	directly no but the columbia tap trail next to uh gets you to the discovery green where the new bike lane begins .
why there is a kia and a hyundai logo on the pc ?	because this used to be a lab field research computer for hyundai when my father worked there .
heh , that 's one of the most tortured arguments describing welfare that i 've ever heard . anyway , you 're very much proving that it 's a thing that people believe .	so , if people can do things in their own self - interest and always succeed , then why do classes exist ?
there 's a lot of butt hurt in here because these people are wealthy .	no , or it would be about river road in the same way . i can guarantee that 's not my issue , i just find the area sad and painful
insanity variant is just plain unfair right now . quickdraw and stock are all you need to melt people .	i 've only got the average joe at the moment . the insanity increases the fire rate right ? that 's basically the only thing that was holding it back in my opinion .
fox or mega man ?	i could do fox , but it has a cut in the lower right hand side of the box from shipping . it is still new in the box , just not mint .
the stains and holes on your shirt give it an extra touch .	while also taking away even the slightest possibility of touch !
trust me , they have to double team suh . i ca n't even tell you the things i 've seen him do on random plays or you 'd call me a liar . he 's a juggernaut .	the dolphins definitely saw it on their first couple drives when they played us last season and thought they could single him up .
she 's obsessed with not breaking rules or laws . i hope you 're right . she 's very talented in that dept .	even if it was technically illegal it 's never enforced . did your wife really think she 'd drop to her knees , pop your dick in her mouth and suddenly a swat team would break down the doors ?
no , because at that point the infant is sentient and can feel pain .	so drug the baby .
i was so fucking ready to jump on that . not 21 .	damn , that 's a bummer . you were n't the only one though . at the moment the submission inbox was opened , the number of incoming entries was so high such that their servers crashed .
does she wear a monocle with her top hat ?	no , i would n't be able to see the monocle over the racks so no point .
that 's putting it lightly . i might actually stay awake for the results this time .	probably not worth it . the prediction at the start of the night from the exit pole is probably going to be more accurate than anything you know before the next morning .
so you are looking for technical support only ? no need for finances ?	at present my problem is with product development , so i can pitch it to the potential investors , or should i first secure some finances , cause no one wants to touch a half baked cookie .
calvin . not charlie brown .	it was n't calvin and hobbes it was the one of snoopy laying on his dog house and and charlie brown laying next to it ! it was pretty cool .
i 'm surprised mexico is n't more aggressive with its own military .	considering the drug war was n't a problem like this until calderon made it a problem worthy of military action , the mexican government has been pretty aggressive .
bohemian rhapsody for sure .	there is no lip syncing that song . there is only terrible car karaoke .
why not give the at - bat to the kid they just called up .	he 's not exactly a kid , he 's got 375 big league abs .
unlike kit peak you ca n't actually get into the observatory . still , it 's great to go up there and camp in the summer . great way to beat the heat .	yeah as long as it has camping i 'm alright with it !
lost both fnatic bets today , with my luck vp will 16 - 0 them now .	u 're going to lose the 3rd unless the map is mirage : d
14 , also 15 in a month . whens your birthday op ?	it 's april 27 , yours ?
wrong . most people do n't vote at all .	i mean those who work in media , i 'm sure most of them vote .
i think they should reset the flairs so i can get a meaningful red flair . this one feels fake .	it only feels fake to you because as a 3s you would have expected at least a few hours as the button overlord .
12 ? damn man , too young to be doing that to yourself . what causes you to do it ? if you ever want to talk , feel free to pm me .	a lot of stuff : my mental health issues , my gender identity problems and the people who oppress me for who i am .
well if anyone else gets a crazy idea like this , especially on the west coast , i hope i 'm around to get a piece of the action .	what part of the west coast ?
yep , that 's what i was thinking as well ! luckily we can share shampoo and face wash , and i 'm going to buy a shower organizer just to simplify that too . thanks !	buy one of the ones on a pole that you can put at the corner of the tub . my wife and i share that with our 2 roommates , and there 's plenty of room for everyone .
nba has the best product but nfl is king in the u . s . and that wo n't change anytime soon .	yeah i was asking who had the best product with the fewest integrity issues . but yeah , violence sells in this country lol .
so this whole u21 team does not actually mean under 21 ?	i think they 're allowed a certain number of players over 21 ? i 'm not sure though , only info i have comes from the football manager .
if we score in the second half , i 'll change my crest to portsmouth for a week . tldr : it ai n't gonna happen . edit : please just kill me now .	he said if the saints score he wears a pompey flair for a week .
the last part of your statement is a bit ironic in that you say if you do n't play to win then what is the point , however you a knowledge chelsea set up to not lose , not to win .	he was talking about the bigger picture . chelsea basically won the league with that draw .
what camera did you use ? that amazing footage .	it 's the mobius action cam with the wide angle lens . you can get it from amazon or motion rc .
how does the fact that cows do n't sleep standing up make cow tipping an urban legend ?	how can yoy push a cow over that is already lying down ?
: 3 oh are we in the same shoe ?	i 've got socks on . no shoes !
the princess bride . it was hailed as the greatest comedy ever and when i finally got to seeing it , it fell flat .	i honestly feel like that 's a movie you would n't love unless you grew up with it .
you gotta catch them while they 're sleeping .	that 's what my uncle always told me about raping senior - aged widows . boy did he love visiting the old folks home . uncle rick you sick fuck
i 'd be impressed if he took the time to make sure that he only shot posers .	in most high schools you could probably just shoot randomly and mostly hit posers .
i do n't know how swatting a bee is being a dick .	killing an animal not attempting to hurt you who 's crucial to a local ecosystem . nah , you 're right , not dickish at all .
are you limited to one gender or that species ?	well it would be one genetic code , so yeah probably
especially with horror games , rpgs , etc that are meant to be a cinematic experience .	watching bioshock being played for the first time genuinely took my breath away . and i totally got upset at some bits of the mass effect trilogy .
no , i have gotten the flu during my soylent diet . i 've not felt this dryness other than before i drink water . what would you say your total water consumption is during the day ?	i do n't keep track . i drink a lot of water to keep my pee clear . i 've been taking diy soylent and never had water problems .
you sure its bent and not just the protruding camera lens ?	yep ! they showed me a little trick back in december to check for a bend . to avoid the camera .
lucky you ! i bought the gtx 970 and got ac : unity . pos game if i ever seen one !	well i did just buy it about a week or two ago . i highly doubt msi would be so cheap as to give a game to people that they know is shit .
that 's fine , as long as scum or city do n't also win the cl .	so if no english team won the cl but everton won the el then 4th spot would still remain a qualifying spot for cl ? i thought only 4 teams from england could be in cl .
it 's brave to see fake incest ? this sub is full of the shit op is referencing .	not as brave as it is just gross . you 're right . it is the crap he is talking about .
soft goal elliott .	idk 2 on 1 in the slot and vrbata is shooting . not an easy one to save .
other nba players do n't care about marketing , they know who can play .	a decade and a half of most prime - time free agents passing up on playing next to dirk says otherwise .
you can submit a report with a video link if you feel someone is exploiting actively .	where do i go to submit this ? the email address ?
wait , so now copyright infringement and taking the work of others without payment is bad ? reddit , you 're giving me whiplash	the difference is that redditors are n't downloading music and movies to sell them and pass them off as their own work . not even remotely the same thing .
i remember lying awake in my bed at night waiting for santa to come . then there was always that awkward silence as he got dressed and left .	i heard the reason his sack is so big is because he only comes once a year .
it reminds me of that one japanese horror webcomic where the creepy quickly moves towards the screen as you scroll . they always come at me at the worst possible moments d :	that one scared me soo damn hard , whenever i closed my eyes for 2 weeks that moment flashed in my brain . jeezus christ i fcking hate that stuff
you 're a solid , dependable fellow . you have rugs pulled from underneath you all the time . nothing works out the way you hope , so you 've grown semi - hopeless .	more true than you know .
do you think that kind of response holds up in a court of law ?	only if the potentially - illegal image has a gold fringe .
you 're a fucking faggot dude	this fuckin guy .
no , it 's because nobody at valve is customer support .	maybe gaben is the only employee at valve , he makes all the games alone , and writes bots to answer steam support tickets .
i 'm going to demand solo - mid , solo - top and jungle or i will feed .	i strongly suspect you 'll be feeding regardless . : p
what do you use as a bookmark ? small animals .	well large animals would make it hard to carry the book around .
yeah well , i 'd love to go for a run or even just play some basketball with friends but the whole sprained ankle thing . i can barely walk on it let alone run . thanks for the advice though .	bummer . i hope you feel better soon .
lpt : 1 . do n't be a dipshit teenager fucking in your parents 'house . 2 . do n't fucking cheat . then you wo n't have to worry about someone finding your trash .	example : having sex in your own house spare bedroom , a week later the parents are in town to see the family and they find the corner of a condom wrapper beside the bed .
strength training machines there 's your real fuck up	show me how to work out my hamstrings with free weights and maybe i 'll agree with you
wow , that is the first commercial that i ever wanted to watch twice !	yeah the second watch through makes so much more sense !
looks like you 're up in new hampshire . i road down a similar road this weekend .	actually in ma , 20 minutes north of boston . this road is literally a 5 minute drive and has access to miles of legal wheeling trails .
scary ! maybe i missed it , but was the voice on the phone a man or a woman ?	the voice sounded very male .
what he really should do is open the mysterious doors next to the you 've been etho 'd fanart .	but we know what 's behind the doors . it 's another door !
i feel like uol should be above yoe fw , omg should be above tsm and fnatic should n't be so high .	omg may have a stacked roster individually , but they play like shit together .
even then , the computer could be made to be able to drive a manual transmission car	that would n't be manual . the type of transmission might stay the same , but the point is you wo n't be doing it .
shallow space is currently in pre - alpha . it is technically playable , but we have n't gotten to any of the balance parts of game development .	does that mean it 's pretty to play but if played i may be a god in a universe of death ?
trust me , i have no problem ending it . but that wo n't help her learn .	its not up to you to teach her .
yeah man , peppered by straight routers bruh	lol honestly i usually do n't watch the clips i just comment shit on but that was some b . s
do you never drive anywhere ?	everyday , just not very far . have you ever left the house ? there 's bears out there .
did you like the post of me in my orange heels better ? that one seems to have hit the mark . maybe not sex vids though ?	sex vids are great . just less man ass please .
not a joke , it 's click bait .	karma is a hell of a drug .
this is a really good piece on how to liverpool climb back to the top of english football , everyone losing their heads following our last 2 league games needs to read it	great article man , thanks for posting that . neil atkinson always putting out interesting pieces , some i agree with some i do n't
i do n't think dd should reflect , it 's not even an spell	it kinda is . spell echo works on it lol
i love when girls know they have sexy feet . very hot !	thanks babe c ;
nope . they 're real as fuck . you gotta feel bad for the guy who 's making these . you can smell the self loathing from over here .	where do you find this stuff ?
that poor , poor kitty . did someone realize the cat would have health problems being in that environment and get it out but it was just too late , or did they just leave the cat in the house ?	basically it was an old lady with a cat living alone . she was basically the only one who had regular contact with it before that day .
this is the big question we need answered in the exit press .	she said on facebook that she was already mostly convinced to play it before he played his advantage .
we get doc . albert 's calling rangers - lightning game 7 on radio .	well how is anybody going to know what 's happening ? it will just sound like sticks hitting pucks and nothing else .
i mean , back in the days of single - shot rifles it was n't such a big deal . but modern guns typically do n't take that long to reload , so i ca n't understand what they were thinking .	even then though , if you only had time to get one shot off and were being charged at , i sure as hell would n't want to have to stop and put the bayonet on my rifle .
i did n't actually know for a long time because she would never leave me alone in the apartment . she arranged all her classes around my course schedule .	ohhhhhh my god that would drive me nuts faster than the food stuff .
why is this a meme suddenly ? i heard the theory a while ago , but why i have seen it referenced a ton the last few days ?	no idea as to why it 's coming back room center , but it 's funny
weak ass joke then .	come on , man . lighten up .

do you have workers building farms ? are your cities in low food areas ? we need more info , like screenshots of your cities and their locations	i never even realized i could build farms , unless you are talking about civ v . both my cities are next to small lakes , one in a small desert and the other in a patch of forest .
why do i want a light switch that says 'on 'when it 's on ? i know when it 's on . you know how i know ? because the light 's on .	it would be better if it was blank when on , and said 'off 'when off , so you can find the thing in the dark .
what anime used this song as their op ? edit : its the ed 1 of hunter x hunter	hunt her ? i hardly know her !
when that happens i never go back to top lane . never . that lane is dead to me , my tower is gone . secretly i resent my team for the rest of the game for making me give up my tower .	this is so me . it 's almost like an ocd obsession . i want all of my towers untouched and as soon as i lose one then i stop caring . just not worth it anymore
my heart is with the court reporter . poor thing has to type all this crap out . lol	has n't d . c . ever heard of speech to text technology ? oh yeah . keeping people employed in out - dated positions is about jobs .
really i feel for may and hammond . they do have their other projects and i will support anything the three do . i will miss tg , but i look forward to the future .	correct me if i 'm wrong here but could n't they just leave the bbc and go elsewhere ? it 's a highly successful show , i 'm sure other networks would love to make it happen
so basically you think women should have no input on how they themselves are treated or what they want . your point of view is already toxic .	where did you get that ? if a woman is unhappy with me she can speak to . if she is still unhappy she can leave . what the fuck ?
just as good as an afternoon flight ?	i prefer a afternoon delight .
exactly . either you cut him and eat his contract or you welcome him back , it 's that simple .	bingo . if you 're not gonna buy him out , do n't pretend he 's not a member of your team anymore . hopefully this does n't continue through the regular season , it 'll get old fast .

ok , i 'll just stop paying tuition after getting 2 years into a degree . that makes sense . then i can be in debt from the first two years and have no degree to show for it . great advice .	was this tuition hike both unexpected and the straw that is going to break your back ? hate to sound so harsh , but this may be the education your budget needs going forward .
well in that case why are you complaining ? since there are multiple meanings of the word and i chose to use one of the other meanings for the word i 'm not in the wrong by using it .	okay , you had a different term . but that is a minority term , as the majority term means it 's a slur . until the dictionary is changed , it is stated and confirmed as a hateful word .
thanks for the information ! i currently have an account with an online bank , would it be hard to cash checks with it ?	get direct deposit if possible .
it 's 10 : 15 pm . why does it sound like someone in my neighborhood is mowing their lawn ?	depends , someone might actually be mowing . do you live in an uptight suburban gated community ?
i would love to see you try to get my dog to walk in the rain .	and i 'd love to see you guys stop making excuses
this one is actually great . i like how he acknowledged him being wrong . he 's a big boy now .	mommy wow .
no one is mentioning the chargers here ? looks like a sideways yellow turd	i did ! it 's a super shame since their old unis , with the dark blue , were gorgeous !
you 're really trying to claim that the difference between her design and the original american flag is the same difference between target 's design and her own ? silly .	alright , then any other black and white flag design . does that suit you better ?
they 're all nice .	i 've been meaning to meet switch , but he do n't answer his door .
you obviously have forgotten what humans are capable of doing in desperate times .	well if we make a change maybe we wont have to live in desperate times .

not so much . ill give it a try in the morning . but they seen pretty solid . if i shake the bars then the car rocks too .	ok , and try the water hose thing . that should give you a more definite answer . if your leak is in the front it wo n't be the alpine windows .
thats the whole point . why the fuck do people think some companies will genuinely care for their customers ? they seem like they do because it helps them gaining money .	valve has never cared about its customers . steam support is proof of that .
what is your stance on rice ?	i do n't like pretentious rice . i like regular sticky cheap rice .
salt pork and boiled cabbage .	that is honestly a favorite meal of mine . i use sausage instead of salt pork
it 's a system so inventive yet horrifying . enemy fire seems almost comforting in comparison .	it 's the single mindedness of it , as well . you can launch and fight whatever 's out there but you ca n't land afterwards . true death or glory stuff .
man it feels good to be canadian .	when i was 19 i was passed i could n't drink now i very happy i was n't in bars under 21 haha .
